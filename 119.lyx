 stood now before the gargoyles that guarded the Headmaster's -- no, the
 Headmistress's office.
 He had been summoned by Professor Sinistra, told that it was an emergency,
 but the gates were not opening for him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration permanent
 every three minutes and fifty-four seconds, irrespective of the size of
 object Transfigured.
 Just once, holding the Philosopher's Stone up to the light of Harry's most
 powerful flashlight in an otherwise darkened closet, Harry had thought
 he'd seen an array of tiny points inside the chunk of crimson glass; but
 Harry hadn't been able to see it again, and now suspected himself of having
 imagined it.
 The Stone had no other powers that Harry could detect, nor did it respond
 to any attempted mental commands.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had given himself until noon tomorrow to figure out how to begin using
 the Stone without it being grabbed by someone else, trying not to think
 about what was still happening, what had always been happening, in the
 meanwhile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ten minutes late, Minerva McGonagall approached, moving in a swift stride.
 Her arms were full of papers, she was once again wearing the Sorting Hat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gargoyles, with a brief sound of grinding stone, bowed low before her.

\begin_layout Standard
“The new password is `Impermanence’,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Understood.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva mounted the long spiral stairs, climbing instead of waiting to be
 carried, Harry following behind her.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We are meeting with Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical
 Law Enforcement; with Alastor Moody, whom you have met; and with Bartemius
 Crouch, Director of the Department of International Magical Cooperation,”
 Minerva said as she climbed.
 “They are Dumbledore’s heirs as much as you or I.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“How -- how's Hermione doing?” Harry hadn't had a chance to ask until now.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Filius said she seemed rather in shock, which I suppose is not surprising.
 She asked where you were, was told you were at a Quidditch game, asked
 where you really were, and refused to speak with anyone about what happened
 until she was allowed to talk with you.
 She was taken to St.
 Mungo's, where,” the Headmistress now sounded slightly perturbed, “a standard
 diagnostic Charm showed Miss Granger as a healthy unicorn in excellent
 physical condition except that her mane needs combing.
 Charms to detect active magic have each time detected her as being in the
 process of transforming into another shape.
 There was an Unspeakable who showed up before Filius, ah, removed him.
 He performed certain spells he probably ought not to have known, and declared
 that Hermione's soul was in healthy condition but at least a mile away
 from her body.
 At that point the senior healers gave up.
 She's currently alone in a cell with the rats and flies
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“She's what?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm sorry, Mr.
 Potter, that's Transfiguration jargon.
 Miss Granger is in an isolation chamber with a cage of tame rats, and a
 box of flies that will bear offspring in a single day.
 Logic suggests that whatever mystery underlies her resurrection, it left
 behind an emanation that is causing the healers’ Charms to produce gibberish.
 But if nothing happens to the rats or to the flies’ offspring, Miss Granger
 will be declared safe to return to Hogwarts after she wakes up again tomorrow
 morning.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry still wasn't sure...
 wasn't sure at 
\emph on
all
\emph default
, what Hermione would think of having been resurrected, at least under these
 particular circumstances.
 He didn't actually think Hermione would yell at him for doing it wrong.
 That was just Harry's brain trying to imagine her as a stereotype.
 Harry had been legitimately exhausted and not thinking very straight when
 he'd come up with that cover story, and Hermione would probably understand
 that part.
 But he couldn't imagine what Hermione 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 think...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I wonder how Miss Granger will feel about having also vanquished You-Know-Who,”
 Minerva said reflectively, climbing the moving stairs fast enough that
 Harry felt out of breath trying to keep up.
 “And people believing the most interesting things about her.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You mean, because she's always self-identified as a normal academic genius,
 and now a bunch of people think of her as the Girl-Who-Revived and everyone
 wants to shake her hand?” Harry said.
 
\emph on
Even though she doesn't remember doing anything to earn it.
 Even though it was all someone else's work and other people's sacrifices,
 and she's getting the credit.
 Even though she doesn't feel like she's actually done anything worthy of
 the way other people treat her, and she's not sure if she can ever live
 up to the person they imagine.

\emph default
 “Gosh, I don't know, I can't imagine what that feels like.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Maybe I shouldn't have subjected her to it.
 But people had to be given
\emph default
 something 
\emph on
to believe or heaven knows what they'd have made up.
 Feeling guilty about this would be stupid.
 I think.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them reached the top of the stairs, and came into the office
 filled with dozens of strange objects, all facing a great desk and a mighty
 throne behind it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva's hand passed over one of those objects, the one with golden wibblers,
 her eyes closing briefly.
 Then Minerva took off the Sorting Hat and put it on a hatrack that held
 three slippers for left feet.
 She transformed the mighty throne into a simple cushioned chair and the
 great desk into a round table, around which four other chairs rose up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry watched it all with a strange pang in his throat.
 He knew, without either of them saying anything, that there should have
 been more ceremony for the changing of the chairs, the changing of the
 table.
 Much more ceremony, for the first time the Headmistress sat down in her
 new office.
 But for whatever reason, there wasn't time, and Minerva McGonagall was
 discarding all that for speed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A wave of Minerva's wand lit the Floo-fire in the fireplace, even as Minerva
 sat down into the chair that had been Dumbledore's.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry quietly took one of the chairs around the table, sitting at Minerva's
 left.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost at once, the Floo-fire burned emeraldine and whirled out Alastor
 Moody, who spun around with his wand raised, taking in the whole room at
 a seeming glance, and then pointed his wand directly at Harry and said
 “Avada Kedavra.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It happened so fast, and took him so completely by surprise, that Harry's
 wand wasn't even half-raised by the time Alastor Moody finished the incantation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Just checking,” Alastor said to the Headmistress, whose own wand was now
 pointed at Alastor, her mouth open as if to say words she couldn't find.
 “Voldie would've tried to dodge, if he'd taken over the boy's body last
 night.
 I'll still need to check the Granger girl, though.” Alastor Moody went to
 Minerva's right and sat down.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had thought, in that split second, to try producing a wordless silver
 Patronus glow from his wand; but his wand hadn't been in place to intercept
 in time, not even close.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Well, if I was feeling invincible before, that does for that.
 What a valuable life lesson, Mr.
 Moody.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the Floo-fire burned green again, and spat out the oldest, grimmest,
 toughest-looking witch Harry had ever seen, like beef jerky given human
 shape.
 The old witch did not have her wand in her hand, but she projected an air
 of authority that was stronger and stricter than Dumbledore's.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This is Director Amelia Bones, Mr.
 Potter,” said Headmistress McGonagall, who'd regained her poise.
 “We are still waiting on Director Crouch
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The corpse of Bartemius Crouch Jr.
 was identified among the dead Death Eaters,” the old witch said without
 preamble, even as she continued toward the chairs.
 “It took us entirely by surprise, and I'm afraid Bartemius is in considerable
 grief about it, on both counts.
 He will not be with us today.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry kept the flinch inward.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones sat down in a chair, sitting to Moody's own right.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Headmistress McGonagall,” said the elder witch, still without hesitation
 or delay, “The Line of Merlin Unbroken, which Dumbledore left to me in
 regency, is not responding to my hand.
 The Wizengamot must have a Chief Warlock who is trustworthy, 
\emph on
at once;
\emph default
 matters are in great flux in Britain.
 I must know what Dumbledore has done, immediately!” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Crap,” muttered Moody.
 His mad-eye was rolling wildly.
 “That's not good, not good at all.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, well,” said Minerva McGonagall, who looked rather apprehensive.
 “I cannot say that for certain.
 Albus -- well, he clearly had an intimation that he might not survive this
 war.
 But I do not think he was expecting Miss Granger to come back from the
 dead and kill Voldemort only hours later.
 I do not think Albus was expecting that at all.
 I am not quite sure what his legacies will make of that
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones rose half out of her chair.
 “You mean to imply that the 
\emph on
Granger
\emph default
 girl may have inherited the Line of Merlin Unbroken? This is a 
\emph on
catastrophe!
\emph default
 She is twelve years old, untested -- surely Albus would not be so irresponsible
 as to leave the Line to whoever happened to defeat Voldemort, without knowing
 
\emph on
who!
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, putting it simply,” Minerva said.
 Her fingers squared the paperwork she'd taken with her, now lying on the
 desk.
 “Albus 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 think he knew who would defeat Voldemort.
 There was a prophecy concerning it, a verified one, which now seems to
 be in abeyance, or -- I don't know, Madam Bones! I have one letter for
 Mr.
 Potter that I am to give him in the event of Albus's death or other departure,
 and then another letter that Albus said Mr.
 Potter would be able to open only after he defeated Voldemort.
 I am not sure what will happen to it now.
 Perhaps Miss Granger will be able to open it, or perhaps it can never be
 opened
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hold up,” Mad-Eye Moody said.
 He reached into his robes, drew out a long, grey-knobbed wand that Harry
 recognized; it was Dumbledore's wand, of a form and style not like any
 other wand in Hogwarts.
 Moody laid the wand on the table.
 “Before we go any further, Albus left me an instruction or two of his own.
 Pick up this wand, boy.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry hesitated, thinking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Albus Dumbledore sacrificed himself for me.
 He trusted Moody.
 This probably isn't a trap.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry began to reach for the wand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It leaped up and flew across the table, into Harry's hand.
 And the moment that Harry's fingers grasped the handle it was like he heard
 a song, a paean of glory and battle that resonated in his mind.
 A wave of white fire ran up the handle and over the wood, magnifying as
 it moved, bursting from the end in a tremendous spray of sparks.
 Through the wood beneath his fingers ran a sense of strength and constrained
 danger, like a leashed wolf.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was also receiving an impression of distinct skepticism, as if the
 wand had some level of awareness, and it was wondering how the hell it
 had ended up being held by a Hogwarts first-year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Right,” said Mad-Eye Moody into the puzzled stares.
 “So it wasn't Miss Granger who defeated Voldie, then.
 Didn't think so.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What.” Amelia Bones spoke the word flatly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mad-Eye Moody gave her a respectful nod.
 “Albus said this wand goes to whoever defeats its previous master.
 Took it off old Grindie, he did.
 Then Voldie defeated Albus, yesterday.
 Do I need to spell it out, Amelia?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones was staring at Harry, her mouth wide open.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That might not be right,” Harry said.
 He swallowed another pang of the awful guilt.
 “I mean, Voldemort used me as a hostage because I, I was stupid, and Dumbledore
 gave himself up to save me, maybe the wand thinks that counts as my defeating
 Dumbledore.
 Um, I did defeat Voldemort, though.
 Vanquished him.
 But I think it's better if nobody has any idea I was there.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beep.
 Tick.
 Whirr.
 Ding.
 Poot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
That
\emph default
 must have taken 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 doing,” Mad-Eye said.
 The scarred man inclined his head slowly, a gesture of profound respect.
 “Don't feel too guilty about losing Albus and David and Flamel, son, no
 matter how stupid you were.
 You won in the end.
 All of us put together never could.
 Just to check, son, you and David also destroyed Voldie's horcrux? And
 you're 
\emph on
certain
\emph default
 it was the real thing?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry hesitated, weighing up the probable consequences of trust, the possible
 disasters of silence, and then shook his head to Moody in reply.
 He'd been planning to tell at least McGonagall about what was now inside
 her school, anyway.
 “Voldemort had...
 rather a lot of horcruxes, actually.
 So instead I Obliviated most of his memories, then Transfigured him into
 this.” Harry raised his hand, and silently pointed to the emerald on his
 ring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Splat.
 Boing.
 Splat.
 Splat.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Huh,” Moody said, leaning back in his chair.
 “Minerva and I will be putting some alarms and enchantments on that ring
 of yours, son, if you don't mind.
 Just in case you forget to sustain that Transfiguration one day.
 And don't go hunting any other Dark wizards, ever, just live a quiet and
 peaceful life.” The scarred man took a handkerchief and wiped at the beads
 of sweat that had now appeared on his forehead.
 “But well done, lad, you and David both, may he rest in peace.
 This was his idea, I'm guessing? Well done, I say.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” said Amelia Bones, who had now regained her composure.
 “We all owe the both of you a tremendous debt of gratitude.
 But I say again that there is urgent business regarding the Line of Merlin
 Unbroken.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I believe,” Minerva McGonagall said slowly, “that I had best give Albus's
 letters to Mr.
 Potter, right now.” At the top of her stack of papers now lay a parchment
 envelope, and a rolled-up parchment scroll sealed with a grey ribbon.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Headmistress gave Harry the parchment envelope, first, and Harry opened
 it.

Though it may shock you to learn, this was the end that I wished in my heart
 would come to pass.
 For as I write this, it yet seems possible that Voldemort may fall by my
 own hand.
 And then, in time, I shall myself become the darkness you must overcome,
 to enter fully into your power.
 For it was said once that you might need to raise your hand against your
 mentor, the one who made you, who you loved; it was said that you might
 be my downfall.
 If you are reading this, then that shall never come to pass, and I am glad
 of it.

Even so, Harry, I would spare you this, the lonely fight against Voldemort.

With my passing, there is none left to oppose Voldemort as an equal save
 you.
 His shadow will fall long and terrible over magical Britain, and many will
 suffer and die for it.
 That shadow will not lift until you destroy its source, until you cleanse
 the heart of the darkness.
 How you are to do this, I do not know.
 If Voldemort knows not the power you bear, then neither do I.
 You must find that power within yourself, you must learn to wield it, you
 must become Voldemort's final judge, and I beg you not to make the error
 of showing him mercy.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
My wand, which I have left to you in Moody's keeping, you must not dare
 to wield against Voldemort.
 For when that wand's master is defeated, it passes to the victor in turn.
 When you have conquered my conqueror, then the wand will answer truly to
 your hand; but if you try to turn it against Voldemort before then, it
 will betray you for certain.
 Keep it out of Voldemort's grasp at all costs.
 I should advise you not to wield that wand at all, yet it is a device of
 great power, which you might need in some desperate case.
 But if you pick it up you must fear its treachery at all times.

In my absence, the Wizengamot will inevitably fall to Malfoy.
 The Line of Merlin Unbroken I have passed to you, with Amelia Bones as

 But she cannot oppose Malfoy for long, not with myself gone and Voldemort
 returned to advise him.
 Soon, I think, the Ministry will fall, and Hogwarts will become the last
 fortress.
 To Minerva I have left Hogwarts's keys, but you alone are its prince, and
 she will help you however she can.

And so, it being clear that this world is not meant to last, I have gambled
 literally everything upon you, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.
 There were no prophecies of how the world might be saved, so I found the
 prophecies that offered loopholes in the destruction; and I brought about
 the strange and complex conditions for those prophecies to come to pass.
 I ensured that Voldemort discovered a certain one of those prophecies,
 and so (even as I had feared) condemned your parents to death and made
 you what you are.
 I wrote a strange hint in your mother's Potions textbook, having no idea
 why I must; and this proved to show Lily how to help her sister, and ensured
 you would gain Petunia Evans's heartfelt love.
 I snuck invisibly into your bedroom in Oxford and administered the potion
 that is given to students with Time-Turners, to extend your day's cycle
 by two hours.
 When you were six years old I smashed a rock that was on your windowsill,
 and to this day I cannot imagine why.

 ones will be recorded, for it was said that you must not look upon them.
 If you think this frustrating, believe me when I say that even your wit
 cannot comprehend what frustration you have been spared.
 I will die, or be lost by you, or in some other way be taken from you --
 the prophecies are unclear, naturally -- without ever once knowing what
 the future truly holds, or why I must do what I do.
 It is all cryptic madness and you are well rid of it.

Harry held the parchment scroll for a long time, staring at nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.

\begin_layout Standard
There were times when the phrase `That explains it’ didn't really seem to
 cover it, but nonetheless, that explained it.

\begin_layout Standard
Absently Harry rolled up the parchment scroll in his fist, still staring
 at nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What does it say?” said Amelia Bones.

\begin_layout Standard
“It's a confession letter,” Harry said.
 “Turns out Dumbledore's the one who killed my pet rock.”

“Yes,” Harry said absently, his mind occupied with thoughts that were, by
 any objective quantification, overwhelmingly more important.

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch was sitting very still in her chair.
 She turned her head, and locked eyes with Minerva McGonagall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meanwhile Harry's brain, which was juggling way too many possibilities over
 way too many time horizons, some of them involving literally billions of
 years and stellar disassembly procedures, declared cognitive bankruptcy
 and started over.

Harry raised his eyes from the rolled-up parchment and looked at Professor-
 at Headmistress McGonagall, at Mad-Eye Moody, and at the leathery-looking
 old witch, as though seeing them for the first time.
 Though he was in fact seeing Amelia Bones for mostly the first time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, whom Albus
 Dumbledore had thought worthy to lead the Wizengamot at least temporarily.
 Her cooperation would be invaluable, maybe

 Dumbledore had chosen her, and he'd read prophecies Harry hadn't seen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones, who had thought she'd been appointed regent over the Line

 the position had gone to, apparently, an eleven-year-old boy.

“I'm terribly sorry about all this,” Harry Potter said, then paused to see
 what effect, if any, this polite statement had produced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Minerva seems to think,” the old witch said, “that you will not take offense
 to honest words.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.
 His Ravenclaw part wanted to include the disclaimer about that being different
 from people blatantly trying to push you down while crying that you were
 intolerant of criticism, but Hufflepuff vetoed.
 Whatever she had to say, Harry would hear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I do not wish to speak ill of the departed,” the old witch said.
 “But since time immemorial, the Line of Merlin Unbroken has passed to those
 who have 
\emph on
thoroughly
\emph default
 demonstrated themselves to be, not only good people, but wise enough to
 distinguish successors who are themselves both good and wise.
 A single break, anywhere along the chain, and the succession might go astray
 and never return! It was a mad act for Dumbledore to pass the Line to you
 at such a young age, even having made it conditional upon your defeat of
 You-Know-Who.
 A tarnish upon Dumbledore's legacy, that is how it will be seen.” The old
 witch hesitated, her eyes still watching Harry.
 “I think it best that nobody outside this room ever learn of it.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Harry said.
 “You...
 don't think very much of Dumbledore, I take it?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I thought...” said the old witch.
 “Well.
 Albus Dumbledore was a better wizard than I, a better

 But the man had his faults.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Because, um.
 I mean.
 Dumbledore 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
 everything you just said.
 About my being young and how the Line works.
 You're acting like you think Dumbledore was unaware of those facts, or
 just ignoring them, when he made his decision.
 It's true that sometimes stupid people, like me, make decisions that crazy.
 But not Dumbledore.
 He was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 mad.” Harry swallowed, forcing a sudden moisture away from his eyes.
 “I think...
 I'm beginning to realize...
 Dumbledore was the only sane person, in all of this, all along.
 The

\emph default
 one who was doing the right things for anything like the right reasons...”

\begin_layout Standard
Madam Bones was cursing under her breath, low dire imprecations that were
 making Minerva McGonagall twitch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm sorry,” Harry said helplessly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mad-Eye was grinning, the scarred face twisting up in a smile.
 “Always knew Albus was up to

\emph default
 he never told the rest of us.
 Lad, you have no idea how hard it is for me not to use my Eye on that scroll.”

\begin_layout Standard
Harry quickly shoved the scroll into his mokeskin pouch.

“Alastor,” Amelia said.
 The old witch's voice was rising.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Dumbledore,” Harry said, the name tasting strange on his tongue, “did make
 one wrong assumption, when he made his decisions.
 He thought we'd be fighting Voldemort for years, all of us together.
 He didn't know I'd vanquish Voldemort immediately.
 It was the right thing for me to do, it saved a lot of lives compared to
 fighting a long battle.
 But Dumbledore thought you would have years to learn me, trust me...
 and instead it was all over in an evening.” Harry inhaled.
 “Can't you just 
\emph on
pretend
\emph default
 we've been fighting Voldemort for years and I earned your trust and everything?
 So that I'm not penalised for winning more quickly than Dumbledore expected?”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You are still a first-year in Hogwarts!” the old witch said.
 “You

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Right, that whole `looking like an eleven-year-old’ thing.” Harry's hand

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am not a fool,” the old witch said.
 “I know you are no ordinary child.
 I have seen you speak to Lucius Malfoy, watched you frighten off a Dementor,
 and witnessed Fawkes grant your plea.
 Anyone with wisdom who saw you before the Wizengamot -- by which I mean
 myself and at most two others -- could guess that you had absorbed some
 portion of You-Know-Who's shredded soul on the night of his undeath, but
 subdued it and turned his knowledge to good ends.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a slight pause in the room.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, yes, of course,” said Minerva McGonagall.
 She sighed, slumped a bit in the Headmistress's chair.
 “As Albus clearly knew 
\emph on
from the very beginning,
\emph default
 but thoughtfully declined to warn me about 
\emph on
in any way whatsoever
\emph default
.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Right,” Moody said.
 “I knew that.
 Yep.
 Perfectly obvious.
 Wasn't confused at all.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I guess that's close enough to the truth,” said Harry.
 “So, um.
 What's the problem, exactly?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The problem,” Amelia Bones said, her voice perfectly even, “is that you
 are a bubbling, unstable blend of a Hogwarts first-year and You-Know-Who.”
 She paused, as though waiting for something.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm getting better about that,” Harry said, since she seemed to be waiting
 on his reply.
 “Quite rapidly, in fact.
 More importantly, it's not something Dumbledore didn't know.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch continued.
 “Giving away your fortune and going in debt to Lucius Malfoy to keep your
 best friend out of Azkaban, as much as it demonstrates your upstanding
 moral character, also demonstrates that you cannot corral the Wizengamot.
 I can see now that you did the right thing for yourself, the thing you
 had to do to maintain your lease on sanity and hold back your inner darkness.
 But you also did a thing that Merlin's heir must not do.
 A sentimental leader can be far worse than a selfish one.
 Albus, master and servant of a phoenix, was barely survivable -- and even
 he opposed you that day.” Amelia gestured in the direction of Mad-Eye Moody.
 “Alastor has hardness.
 He has cunning.
 He still does not have the talent for government.
 You, Harry Potter, do not yet have the sternness, the capacity for sacrifice,
 to direct even the Order of the Phoenix.
 And being what you are, you 
\emph on
must not try
\emph default
 to become that person.
 Not now, not at your age.
 Align and fuse your divided soul in your own time, if you possibly can.
 Do not try to be Chief Warlock while you are doing it.
 If Albus thought that was a good idea, he was crafting a nicer story at
 the expense of real-world practicality.
 I do think the man had a problem with that.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's eyes were a bit wide, listening to all this.
 “Um...
 what exactly do you think is going on in here?” Harry tapped his head just
 above his ear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I imagine that inside you is the soul of a boy who remains honest and true,
 gathering his will to force down the fragment of Voldemort's spirit that
 tries to consume him, even as it howls at him that he is sentimental and
 weak -- did you just giggle?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Sorry.
 But seriously, it wasn't ever 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 bad.
 More like having a lot of bad habits I needed to break.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ahem,” said Headmistress McGonagall.
 “Mr.
 Potter, I think at the start of this year it 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 that bad.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bad habits that chained into and triggered each other.
 Yes, those are a bit more of a problem.” Harry sighed.
 “And you, Madam Bones...
 er.
 Sorry if I'm wrong about this.
 But my guess is that you're feeling a bit upset that the Line went to an
 eleven-year-old?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not the way you are thinking,” the old witch said calmly.
 “Though it is natural for you to suspect me.
 The position of Chief Warlock is not one I will find pleasant, even compared
 to the horrors of Magical Law Enforcement.
 Albus persuaded me on the matter, and I would say that I took some convincing,
 but the truth is that I did not waste his time in an argument I expected
 to lose.
 I knew I would hate the task, and I knew I would do it anyway.
 Minerva says you have some amount of common sense, especially when others
 remind you of it.
 Can you really see yourself standing upon the Wizengamot's high dais? Are
 you sure it is not some remnant of You-Know-Who that imagines himself suited
 to the position, or even desires it at all?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took off his glasses and massaged his forehead.
 His scar still ached a bit, from the damage he'd done by picking at it
 yesterday until it bled in a suitably dramatic fashion.
 “I do have some common sense, and yes, being Chief Warlock sounds like
 a huge amount of aggravation and a job that, in reality, does not fit me
 the tiniest bit.
 The trouble is.
 Um.
 I'm not sure the Line of Merlin is just about being Chief Warlock.
 There's, um.
 I suspect...
 that there's weird other stuff that goes along with it.
 And that Dumbledore meant me to take responsibility for the...
 other stuff.
 And that the other stuff is...
 possibly quite 
\emph on
amazingly
\emph default
 important.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Crap,” Moody said.
 Then Alastor Moody repeated, “Crap.
 Kid, should you even be saying this to us?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I don't know,” Harry said.
 “If there's a user manual, I haven't looked at it yet.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Crap.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And if these other matters require sternness and sacrifice?” Amelia Bones
 said, still calmly.
 “If they test you as you were tested before the Wizengamot? I am old, Harry
 Potter, and I am not without knowledge of mysteries.
 You have seen how I was able to perceive your own nature at nearly a glance.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Amelia,” Mad-Eye Moody said.
 “What would have happened if you'd had to fight You-Know-Who last night?”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch shrugged.
 “I would have died, I expect.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You'd have 
\emph on
lost,
\emph default
” said Alastor Moody.
 “And the Boy-Who-Lived didn't just take out Voldie, he set it up so that
 his good friend Hermione Granger came 
\emph on
back from the dead
\emph default
 at the same time Voldie resurrected himself.
 There's no way in hell or double hell that was an accident, and I don't
 think it was David's idea either.
 Amy, the truth is, none of us know what the keeper of Merlin's legacy has
 to 
\emph on
do
\emph default
.
 But we're not the right kind of crazy for this crap.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones frowned.
 “Alastor, you know I've dealt with strange things before.
 Dealt with them quite well, in my opinion.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yeah.
 You 
\emph on
dealt with
\emph default
 the crap so you could go back to real life.
 You're not the kind of crazy that builds a castle out of the crap and lives
 there.” Moody sighed.
 “Amy, on some level you know exactly why Albus had to leave who-knows-what-job
 to the poor kid.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch's fists clenched on the table.
 “Do you have any idea of the 
\emph on
disaster
\emph default
 it would be for Britain? Call me sane, but I cannot accept that outcome!
 I have worked too long toward this day to see it fall apart now, 
\emph on
now
\emph default
 of all times!” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse me,” Headmistress McGonagall said, sounding quite precise and Scottish.
 “Is there any reason why Mr.
 Potter cannot simply instruct the Line that Madam Bones is his regent for
 the position of Chief Warlock, but not anything having to do with the Departmen
t of Mysteries, until he comes of age? If Albus could tell the Line to appoint
 a regent only until Voldemort's defeat, it is clearly capable of following
 complex orders.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly, this unexpected hammer-blow of common sense was absorbed by everyone
 present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry opened his mouth to agree to appoint Amelia Bones his regent for Wizengamo
t-related matters, and then hesitated again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Harry said.
 “Um.
 Madam Bones, I would much prefer if you took charge of handling the Wizengamot
 instead of me.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“In that we are agreed,” said the old witch.
 “Shall we let it be done?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a sort of frustrated dropping-back of the others.
 “What is the problem, Mr.
 Potter?” said the Headmistress, in a voice that indicated she hoped it
 was nothing serious.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um.
 I think there's a couple of things I might have to do very soon that could...
 prove politically controversial, and in exchange for handing over the Line's
 political power to Madam Bones I'm going to want her...
 um, cooperation on some things.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones exchanged another long stare with Minerva McGonagall.
 Then she looked back at Harry Potter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am indignant at your request!” Amelia Bones said.
 “Your hesitancy has told me that you are weak and unused to bargaining,
 and will probably fold if I push back.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry closed his eyes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Slightly
\emph default
 dark-tinged Harry opened them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” Harry said, “let me rephrase.
 I don't mean to interfere with your work on a day-to-day or even month-to-month
 basis, but I can't just toss off the final responsibility that Dumbledore
 left me.
 I'm not going to owl you bizarre parchments out of nowhere, there can be
 discussions first, but at some point I may have to give you an order.
 If you refuse the order I might have to take back the Line's Wizengamot
 functions and assume direct control.
 Can you handle that?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And if I say no?” said the old witch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Slight, slight the dark tinge...

\emph default
 “I don't have an alternative to you lined up.
 I could start by asking Augusta Longbottom who she thought might be suitable
 and work from there.
 But it may be important that we keep to Dumbledore's plan as much as possible,
 since I don't know exactly why he did the things he did, and he thought
 Amelia Bones should be Chief Warlock for a time.
 I'm not going to pull Merlin's name on you, but...
 no, strike that, I 
\emph on
am
\emph default
 going to pull Merlin's name on you, this might or might not be insanely
 important.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch thought for a time, her eyes going from person to person around
 the table.
 “I am not satisfied with this,” she said after a time.
 “But the Wizengamot must be called to order soon.
 It will do for now.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly the old witch reached into her robes, and took out a short rod of
 stone, dark stone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She placed the rod on the table before Harry.
 “Take what is yours,” she said.
 “And then do please give it back.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry reached out his hand to take it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the moment that Harry's fingers first touched the dark stone

nothing happened.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, perhaps Merlin hadn't been given to melodrama.
 That could explain why his final legacy looked like a small, unassuming
 dark rod.
 If that was all that was needed for its function, that would be all that
 was there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took up the Line, frowning at it.
 “I'd like to appoint Amelia Bones as my regent for Wizengamot-related functions.
” Then, the thought occurring to him that he needed to specify a stopping
 point to define a regency, Harry added, “Until I say that I've taken it
 back.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry made a face.
 He'd been hoping for more from the Line, but it was just a key to places
 in the Department of Mysteries where interesting things were kept, or to
 seals where Merlin and his successors had stashed things that shouldn't
 be destroyed but ought to be kept from general circulation.
 Aside from that, the Line didn't do much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Line didn't let you bypass the Interdict of Merlin either.
 No, not even if the fate of the galaxy was at stake.
 Not even if the person seemed sane, had taken an Unbreakable Vow, and honestly
 believed the world was about to be destroyed otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Merlin had dreamed of a long run, a world that would last for eons and not
 just centuries.
 The world had no reason not to last 
\emph on
forever,
\emph default
 if the truly dangerous powers were removed and kept gone.
 Conversely, a single loophole in the safeguards made the world's destruction
 only a matter of time.
 Someday Merlin's Line would pass to the wrong person.
 It could reject the obviously unworthy, but eventually it would pass into
 hands too subtly flawed for the Line to detect.
 This was inevitable, when dealing with human beings, and Harry needed to
 keep that in mind before he sealed something where future Line-holders
 could retrieve it -- the disaster of its inevitable misuse 
\emph on
someday
\emph default
 needed to be outweighed by its benefits over the next few thousand years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry let out a sad small sigh, under his breath.
 
\emph on
Merlin, you idiot...

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thinking that didn't unlock any final safeguards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There wasn't anything currently on fire in the Department of Mysteries,
 so Harry carefully placed the Line back on the table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you,” the old witch said.
 She picked up the rod of dark stone.
 “Do you know how I am to use it to call the Wizengamot to order, or --
 never mind, I shall just try striking the podium.
 That seems obvious enough.
 To the rest of the country, of course, I am the Chief Warlock so far as
 anyone knows except us four.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry hesitated.
 Then he imagined the owls he would receive if anyone knew he was allowed
 to second-guess the Chief Warlock, and what that would do to Amelia's negotiati
ng power.
 “Fine.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia tucked the rod back into her robes.
 “I will not say it was a pleasure doing business with you, Boy-Who-Lived,
 but it could have been much worse.
 Thank you kindly for that.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was already feeling worried about the exact balance of power here,
 from the way Madam Bones was acting.
 The others had, quite logically, deduced that it had been mostly David
 Monroe who'd planned the way to defeating Voldemort, which meant they were
 still underestimating him.
 It might take a crisis of some type, with Harry figuring it out successfully
 for once instead of screwing up, before Amelia Bones started to respect
 his authority.
 Or believe in it at all, actually...
 “So,” Harry said.
 “Any weirdness for me that you would have brought to Dumbledore while he
 was around?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia looked thoughtful.
 “Since you ask...
 I can think of three things, indeed.
 First, we don't have the faintest notion what ritual was used to sacrifice
 the Death Eaters and resurrect You-Know-Who.
 It corresponds to no known legend, and the magic traces from the ritual
 have been eradicated.
 So far as my Aurors can tell, everyone's heads fell off their necks due
 to natural causes.
 Except for Walden MacNair, who was killed by magical fire after firing
 a Killing Curse from his wand.
 A very mysterious ritual indeed.” She was giving Harry Potter a rather 
\emph on
precise
\emph default
 look.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry considered this, choosing his words carefully.
 Voldemort had said he'd put up wards, so Harry had been confident of not
 being observed by Time-Turned Aurors, but still...
 “I think this is a matter you don't need to investigate too hard, Madam
 Bones.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old witch grinned slightly.
 “We can't be seen to go easy on the investigation of so many Noble deaths,
 Harry Potter.
 When I heard retold your particular account of David's last stand, I made
 certain to send investigators whom I considered 
\emph on
reliable
\emph default
 in the usual quality of their work.
 Auror Nobbs and Auror Colon, in fact, who are widely respected outside
 my Department.
 I found their report to be quite fascinating reading.” Amelia paused.
 “There's a possibility that Augustus Rookwood left a ghost

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Exorcise it before anyone talks to it,” Harry said, conscious of the sudden
 hammering of his heart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, sir,” the old witch said dryly.
 “I shall disrupt the soul's anchoring a little, and none shall be the wiser
 when it fails to materialize.
 The second matter is that there was a still-living human arm found among
 the Dark Lord's things
\begin_inset space ~

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bellatrix,” Harry said.
 His mind had leaped back, made the connection that ongoing trauma had blurred.
 “I think that's Bellatrix Black's arm.” 
\emph on
Lesath Lestrange hadn't been named as someone who'd lost a parent.

\emph default
 “Oh, bloody hell.
 She's still out there, isn't she.
 Can you use her arm to track her down somehow?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 “I see.
 As I was saying, a still-living human arm was found among the Dark Lord's

Moody and Amelia nodded in unison.
 “Good guess, son,” said Moody.

\begin_layout Standard
It might seem literally inevitable that Harry's past stupidity was going
 to come back and haunt him in some horrible fashion later, but that was
 no reason not to try subverting the plot.
 “I expect you've thought of this already,” Harry said, “but the obvious
 next step is to put out your equivalent of an international bulletin for
 a thin witch missing her left arm.
 Oh, and add twenty-five thousand Galleons pledged from me -- Headmistress,
 it's fine, please trust me on this -- to whatever reward is being offered.”

\begin_layout Standard
“Well said.” The old witch leaned forward slightly.
 “The third and final matter...
 there was one truly puzzling element to last night's events, and I am curious
 to see what you make of it, Harry Potter.
 Found among the corpses was the head and the body of Sirius Black.”

\begin_layout Standard
“So he is,” said Madam Bones.
 “We checked that at once.
 The Azkaban guards reported that Sirius Black was still in his cell.
 Black's head and body have been transported to the St.
 Mungo's morgue, and show the same cause of death as the other Death Eaters,
 that is to say, his head spontaneously fell off.
 I am also told that Sirius Black is, as of this morning, sitting in the
 corner of his cell rocking back and forth with his head between his hands.
 No other duplicate Death Eaters have been found.
 Yet.”

There was a pause filled with ticking and whooping things, as people considered

“I would have thought so too when I was your age, dear,” said Amelia.
 “It is the sixth strangest thing I have ever seen.”

“You see, son?” said Moody.
 “This sort of thing is why nobody, even me, can ever be paranoid enough.”
 The scarred man tilted his head, looking thoughtful, as his bright blue
 eye kept ever-roving.
 “Twin brother, concealed from the rest of the world? Walpurga Black gave
 birth to twins, couldn't bear to kill one, knew old Pollux would demand
 it...
 nah, ain't buyin' it.”

“Any ideas, Mr.

 “Or is this another matter into which my Department should not inquire
 too closely?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry closed his eyes and thought.

\begin_layout Standard
Sirus Black had hunted down Peter Pettigrew, instead of fleeing the country
 as common sense would have suggested.

\begin_layout Standard
Black had been found in the middle of the street, surrounded by bodies,
 laughing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing left of Pettigrew except one finger.

\begin_layout Standard
Pettigrew had been a spy for the Light, not a double agent but somebody
 who snuck around and found things out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the conspiracy theories about Pettigrew had been that he was an Animagus,
 since he'd been good at ferreting out secrets even in his Hogwarts years.

\begin_layout Standard
Dementors sapped all the magic in their vicinity.

Professor Quirrell had said something about a particular type of magic that

Harry opened his eyes again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Was Peter Pettigrew a secret Metamorphmagus?”

\begin_layout Standard
Amelia Bones's face changed.
 She made a single croaking noise and fell backward within her chair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, in fact...” Minerva said slowly.
 “Why?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Sirius Black Confunded Peter Pettigrew,” Harry's voice explained patiently,
 “to force him to change shape and pretend to be Black.
 By the time the Confundus wore off, Peter was in Azkaban and couldn't change
 back.
 The Aurors are used to people in Azkaban saying absolutely anything to
 get out, so they didn't listen while Peter Pettigrew was screaming about
 it over and over again until his voice wore out.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even Mad-Eye Moody's face showed the horror, then.
 
\end_layout

“In retrospect,” said Harry's voice, which seemed to be operating entirely

Harry nodded, feeling like his neck and head were moving on puppet strings.
 “The Dark Lord's most fanatic and devoted servant, a natural nucleus of
 opposition for anyone who contested Lucius's control of the Death Eaters.
 You thought Lucius was distracted.”

Everyone looked at Harry with astonishment, none more than Minerva McGonagall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Something else seemed to have taken over Harry's voice.
 “There's four things we still need to discuss.
 An innocent man has been in Azkaban for ten years, eight months, and fourteen
 days.
 He can stay there a few minutes longer.
 That's how urgent those four things are.”

 Can you compile that by tonight?”

\begin_layout Standard
“Within the hour,” said Amelia Bones.
 She looked gray.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.
 “Second.
 Azkaban is over.
 You'll need to start preparations now to move the prisoners to Nurmengard
 or other secure non-Dementor prisons, and to provide treatment for their
 Dementor exposure.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I,” said Amelia.
 The old witch seemed bent, diminished.
 “I...
 do not think, that even with this...
 scandal, that the remainder of the Wizengamot will bend...
 and the Dementors must be fed, not so much as we have fed them, but they
 must be given some victims, or they will roam the world, prey on innocents...”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It doesn't matter what the Wizengamot says,” Harry said.
 “Because

 “Because

 He thought he could see the shape now of the immediate future, could see

“Impossible!” spat Mad-Eye Moody.

“Merlin,” whispered Amelia Bones.
 “Oh, dear Merlin.

Harry was crying now, huge ragged breaths bursting from him.
 But he didn't stop talking.
 Somewhere out there Peter Pettigrew was waiting while Harry cried.

Somewhere out there, everyone was waiting while he cried.

“Third.
 Somewhere just inside the wards of Hogwarts.

 There's going to be a high-security h-h-hospital.
 With very powerful guards, that have taken Unbreakable Vows, I don't, I

“Harry,” said the Headmistress, “both of them think you've gone mad, they
 don't know you well enough to know better.
 You need to slow down and explain.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead Harry reached into his pouch and made sign language with his fingers,
 and lifted out, his fingers straining, a five-kilo chunk of gold larger
 than his fist, from when he'd been experimenting this morning.
 It made a heavy thud as it landed on the table.

Moody reached over and tapped it with his wand, and then his throat made
 an incomprehensible sound.

\begin_layout Standard
“That's your starting budget, Alastor, if you need money right away.
 Nicholas Flamel didn't make the Philosopher's Stone, he stole it, Dumbledore
 didn't know the secret history but Monroe did.
 Once you know how it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to
 full health and youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds.
 Three hundred sixty people per day.
 One hundred and thirty-four thousand healings per year.
 That should be enough to stop, all the wizards everywhere, and all the
 goblins and house-elves and whoever, from dying.
 Of old age, or anything else.” Harry was wiping away tears, over and over.
 “Flamel had more blood on his hands than a hundred Voldemorts, for all
 the people he could've saved and didn't.
 The whole time, Moody, the Philosopher's Stone could've healed all your
 scars and given you back your leg, any time Flamel felt like it.
 Dumbledore didn't know.
 I'm sure he didn't know.” Harry smiled shakily.
 “I can't imagine you as a teenage witch, Madam Bones, but I bet it looks
 good on you.
 That'll give you more energy for trying to keep the Wizengamot from messing
 with me, because if they get the idea that the Stone is something they
 can mess with in any way, tax, regulate, I don't care, Hogwarts is going
 to secede from Britain and become its own country.
 Headmistress, Hogwarts is no longer dependent on the Ministry for gold,
 or for that matter food.
 You may reform the educational curriculum at will.
 I'm thinking we may want to add some more advanced courses soon, especially
 in Muggle studies.”

 Someone would think of it, someone would talk, someone would try it.
 The probability was as close to certainty as made no difference.

What happened if you Transfigured a cubic millimeter of up quarks, just

 “Never mind.
 Chief Warlock Bones, I've given the regency of the Wizengamot into your
 hands.
 Please use that position to announce internationally that the Stone's healing
 power will soon be made available to all, and that meanwhile, all dying
 patients are to be kept alive at any cost, no matter what magic is required
 to do it.
 That announcement is your absolute priority.
 When you have done that you may rescue Peter Pettigrew and tell your old
 Department to begin preparations for shutting down Azkaban.
 Then please have someone prepare a full list of imprisoned Death Eaters
 and what was said at their trials and whether Lucius seemed strangely uninteres

 Thank you.
