Harry did so.

\begin_layout Standard
The office of the Deputy Headmistress was clean and well-organised; on the
 wall immediately adjacent to the desk was a maze of wooden cubbyholes of
 all shapes and sizes, most with several parchment scrolls thrust into them,
 and it was somehow very clear that Professor McGonagall knew exactly what
 every cubbyhole meant, even if no one else did.
 A single parchment lay on the actual desk, which was, aside from that,
 clean.
 Behind the desk was a closed door barred with several locks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall was sitting on a backless stool behind the desk, looking
 puzzled

 her eyes had widened, with perhaps a slight note of apprehension, as she
 saw Harry.

“Mr.

\end_inset

Potter?” said Professor McGonagall.
 “What is this about?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's mind went blank.
 He'd been instructed by the game to come here, he had been expecting 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 to have something in mind…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mr.

\end_inset

Potter?” said Professor McGonagall, starting to look slightly annoyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered at this point that he 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 have something he'd been planning to discuss with Professor McGonagall.
 Something important and well worth her time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um…” Harry said.
 “If there are any spells you can cast to make sure no one's listening to
 us…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall stood up from her chair, firmly closed the outer door,
 and began taking out her wand and saying spells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was at this point that Harry realised he was faced with a priceless and
 possibly irreplaceable opportunity to offer Professor McGonagall a Comed-Tea
 and he couldn't believe he was seriously thinking that and it would be
 fine the soda would vanish after a few seconds and he told that part of
 himself to 
\emph on
shut up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It did, and Harry began to organise mentally what he was going to say.
 He hadn't planned to have this discussion 
\emph on
quite
\emph default
 so soon, but so long as he was here…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall finished a spell that sounded a lot older than Latin,
 and then she sat down again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” she said in a quiet voice.
 “No one's listening.” Her face was rather tight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Oh, right, she's expecting me to blackmail her for information about the
 prophecy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eh, Harry'd get around to that some other day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's about the Incident with the Sorting Hat,” Harry said.
 (Professor McGonagall blinked.) “Um… I think there's an extra spell on the
 Sorting Hat, something that the Sorting Hat itself doesn't know about,
 something that triggers when the Sorting Hat says Slytherin.
 I heard a message that I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws aren't supposed to hear.
 It came the moment the Sorting Hat was off my head and I felt the connection
 break.
 It sounded like a hiss and like English at the same time,” there was a
 sharp intake of breath from McGonagall, “and it said: Salutations from
 Slytherin to Slytherin, if you would seek my secrets, speak to my snake.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at Harry as
 if he'd grown another two heads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So…” Professor McGonagall said slowly, as though she couldn't believe the
 words that were coming out of her own lips, “you decided to come to me
 right away and tell me about it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, yes, of course,” Harry said.
 There was no need to admit how long it had taken him to actually think
 of that.
 “As opposed to, say, trying to research it myself, or telling any of the
 other children.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I… see,” Professor McGonagall said.
 “And if, perhaps, you were to discover the entrance to Salazar Slytherin's
 legendary Chamber of Secrets, an entrance that you and you alone could
 open…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I would close the entrance and report to you at once so that a team of
 experienced magical archaeologists could be assembled,” Harry said promptly.
 “Then I would open up the entrance again and they would go in very carefully
 to make sure that there was nothing dangerous.
 I might go in later to look around, or if they needed me to open up something
 else, but it would be after the area had been declared clear and they had
 photographs of how everything looked before people started tromping around
 their priceless historical site.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall sat there with her mouth open, staring at him like
 he'd just turned into a cat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor,” Harry said kindly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I think,” Professor McGonagall said in a rather choked voice, “that you
 
\emph on
far
\emph default

Potter.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That sounded about right.
 Although… “A Hufflepuff would've said the same thing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
McGonagall paused, struck.
 “
\emph on
That's
\emph default
 true.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Sorting Hat offered me Hufflepuff.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She blinked at him as though she couldn't believe her own ears.
 “Did it 
\emph on
really?
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter,” McGonagall said, and now her voice was low, “five decades ago was
 the last time a student died within the walls of Hogwarts, and I am now
 certain that five decades ago was the last time someone heard that message.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A chill went through Harry.
 “Then I will be 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 sure to take no action 
\emph on
whatsoever
\emph default
 on this matter without consulting you, Professor McGonagall.” He paused.
 “And may I suggest that you get together the best people you can find and
 see if it's possible to get that extra spell off the Sorting Hat… and if
 you can't do that, maybe put on 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 spell, a Quietus that briefly activates just as the Hat is being removed
 from a student's head, that might work as a patch.
 There, no more dead students.” Harry nodded in satisfaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall looked even more stunned, if such a thing were imaginable.
 “I cannot 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 award you enough points for this without giving the House Cup to Ravenclaw
 outright.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Harry said.
 “Um.
 I'd rather not earn 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 many House points.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now Professor McGonagall was giving him a strange look.
 “Why not?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was having a little difficulty putting it into words.
 “Because it would be just too sad, you know? Like… like back when I was
 still trying to go to school in the Muggle world, and whenever there was
 a group project, I'd go ahead and do the whole thing myself because the
 others would only slow me down.
 I'm fine with earning lots of points, more than anyone else even, but if
 I earn enough to be decisive in winning the House Cup just by myself, then
 it's like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw on my back and that's too sad.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see…” McGonagall said hesitantly.
 It was apparent that this way of thinking had never occurred to her.
 “Suppose I only awarded you fifty points, then?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shook his head again.
 “It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for grownup
 things that I can be part of and they can't.
 How is Terry Boot supposed to earn fifty points for reporting a whisper
 he heard from the Sorting Hat? It wouldn't be fair at all.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see why the Sorting Hat offered you Hufflepuff,” said Professor McGo\SpecialChar \-
nagall.
 She was eyeing him with a strange respect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That made Harry choke up a bit.
 He'd honestly thought he wasn't worthy of Hufflepuff.
 That the Sorting Hat had just been trying to shove him anywhere but Ravenclaw,
 into a House whose virtues he didn't have…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall was smiling now.
 “And if I tried to give you 
\emph on
ten
\emph default
 points…?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Are you going to explain where those ten points came from, if anyone asks?
 There might be a lot of Slytherins, and I don't mean the children at Hogwarts,
 who would be really 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 angry if they knew about the spell being taken off the Sorting Hat and
 found out I was involved.
 So I think that absolute secrecy is the better part of valour.
 No need to thank me, ma'am, virtue is its own reward.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So it is,” Professor McGonagall said, “but I do have a very special something
 else to give you.
 I see that I have greatly wronged you in my thoughts, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

Potter.
 Please wait here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She got up, went over to the locked back door, waved her wand, and a sort
 of blurry curtain sprang up around her.
 Harry could neither see nor hear what was going on.
 It was a few minutes later that the blur vanished and Professor McGonagall
 was standing there, facing him, with the door behind her looking as though
 it hadn't ever been opened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Professor McGonagall held out in one hand a necklace, a thin golden
 chain bearing in its center a silver circle, within which was the device
 of an hourglass.
 In her other hand was a folded pamphlet.
 “This is for you,” she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wow! He was going to get some sort of neat magical item as a quest reward!
 Apparently that business with refusing offers of monetary rewards until
 you got a magic item actually worked in real life, not just computer games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry accepted his new necklace, smiling.
 “What is it?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall took a breath.
 “Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter, this is an item which is ordinarily lent only to children who have
 already shown themselves to be highly responsible, in order to help them
 with difficult class schedules.” McGonagall hesitated, as though about to
 add something else.
 “I 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 emphasise, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter, that this item's true nature is 
\emph on
secret
\emph default
 and that you must 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 tell any of the other students about it, or let them see you using it.
 If that's not acceptable to you, then you can give it back now.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can keep secrets,” Harry said.
 “So what does it do?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So far as the other students are concerned, this is a Spimster wicket and
 it is used to treat a rare, non-contagious magical ailment called Spontaneous
 Duplication.
 You wear it under your clothes, and while you have no reason to show it
 to anyone, you also have no reason to treat it as an awful secret.
 Spimster wickets are not interesting.
 Do you understand, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Potter?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded, his smile widening.
 He sensed the work of a

 Slytherin.
 “And what does it 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 do?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's a Time-Turner.
 Each spin of the hourglass sends you one hour back in time.
 So if you use it to go back two hours every day, you should always be able
 to get to sleep at the same time.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's suspension of disbelief blew completely out the window.

“Ehehehehhheheh…” Harry's mouth said.
 He was now holding the necklace away from him as though it were a live
 bomb.
 Well, no, not as if it were a live bomb, that didn't

 Harry held the necklace away from him as though it were a time machine.

Say, Professor McGonagall, did you know that time-reversed ordinary matter
 looks just like antimatter? Why yes it does! Did you know that one kilogram
 of antimatter encountering one kilogram of matter will annihilate in an
 explosion equivalent to 43 million tons of TNT? Do you realise that I myself
 weigh 41 kilograms and that the resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse me,” Harry managed to say, “but this sounds really really 
\emph on
really REALLY DANGEROUS!
\emph default
” Harry's voice didn't quite rise to a shriek, he couldn't possibly scream
 loud enough to do this situation justice so there was no point in trying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall looked upon him with tolerant affection.
 “I'm glad you're taking this seriously, Mr.

Potter, but Time-Turners aren't

 We wouldn't give them to children if they were.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Really,” Harry said.
 “Ahahahaha.
 Of course you wouldn't give time machines to children if they were dangerous,
 what 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 I thinking? So just to be clear, sneezing on this device will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 send me into the Middle Ages where I will run over Gutenberg with a horse
 cart and prevent the Enlightenment? Because, you know, I hate it when that
 happens to me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
McGonagall's lips were twitching in that way she had when she was trying
 not to smile.
 She offered Harry the pamphlet she was holding, but Harry was carefully
 holding out the necklace with both hands and staring at the hourglass to
 make sure it wasn't about to turn.
 “Don't worry,” McGonagall said after a momentary pause, when it became
 clear that Harry wasn't going to move, “that can't possibly happen, Mr.

 The Time-Turner cannot be used to move more than six hours backwards.
 It can't be used more than six times in any day.”

“Oh, good, very good, that.
 And if someone bumps into me the Time-Turner will

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, they

 “And I do think I've heard about strange things happening if they're broken.
 But nothing like 
\emph on
that!

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Perhaps,” Harry said when he could speak again, “you ought to provide your
 time machines with some sort of 
\emph on

\emph default
, rather than 
\emph on
leaving the glass exposed
\emph default
, so as to 
\emph on

\end_layout

Harry took a moment to process this.
 His hands relaxed, just a little, from their white grip on the hourglass
 chain.
 Like he wasn't holding a time machine, just a live nuclear warhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So…” Harry said slowly.
 “People just find that the universe… happens to be self-consistent, somehow,
 even though it has time-travel in it.
 If I and my future self interact then I'll see the same thing as both of
 me, even though, on my own first run through, my future self is already
 acting in full knowledge of things that, from my own perspective, haven't
 happened yet…” Harry's voice trailed off into the inadequacy of English.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Correct, I think,” said Professor McGonagall.
 “Although wizards

 that advice?”

Professor McGonagall pursed her lips.
 “I understand that it can be quite disconcerting.”

Professor McGonagall actually laughed.
 It was a pleasant, glad sound that seemed surprisingly out of place on
 that stern face.

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall offered him a few more pleasantries, demanded a few
 more promises to which Harry nodded, said something about not talking to
 snakes where anyone could hear him, reminded him to read the pamphlet,
 and then somehow Harry found himself standing outside her office with the
 door closed firmly behind him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Gaahhhrrrraa…” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why yes his mind 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 blown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not least by the fact that, if not for the Prank, he might well have never
 obtained a Time-Turner in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or would Professor McGonagall have given it to him anyway, only later in
 the day, whenever he got around to asking about his sleep disorder or telling
 her about the Sorting Hat's message? And would he, at that time, have wanted
 to pull a prank on himself which would have led to him getting the Time-Turner
 
\emph on
earlier?
\emph default
 So that the only 
\emph on
self-consistent
\emph default
 possibility was the one in which the Prank started before he even woke
 up in the morning…?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry found himself considering, for the first time in his life, that the
 answer to his question might be literally 
\emph on
inconceivable.

\emph default
 That since his own brain contained neurons that only ran forwards in time,
 there was 
\emph on
nothing
\emph default
 his brain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate
 to the operation of a Time Turner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up until this point Harry had lived by the admonition of E.
 T.
 Jaynes that if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a fact about
 your own state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your
 uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact about whatever you were uncertain
 about; that ignorance existed in the mind, not in reality; that a blank
 map did not correspond to a blank territory.
 There were mysterious questions, but a mysterious answer was a contradiction
 in terms.
 A phenomenon could be mysterious 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 some particular person, but there could be no phenomena mysterious of themselve
s.
 To worship a sacred mystery was just to worship your own ignorance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated.
 People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and biology
 and astronomy and thought that these matters had always been the proper
 meat of science, that they had 
\emph on
never been
\emph default
 mysterious.
 The stars had once been mysteries.
 Lord Kelvin had once called the nature of life and biology 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 the response of muscles to human will and the generation of trees from
 seeds 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 a mystery “infinitely beyond” the reach of science.
 (Not just a little beyond, mind you, but 
\emph on
infinitely
\emph default
 beyond.
 Lord Kelvin certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from 
\emph on
not knowing something
\emph default
.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the human
 species right up until someone solved it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for the first time, he was up against the prospect of a mystery that
 was threatening to be 
\emph on
permanent
\emph default
.
 If Time didn't work by acyclic causal networks then Harry didn't understand
 what was meant by cause and effect; and if Harry didn't understand causes
 and effects then he didn't understand what sort of stuff reality might
 be made of instead; and it was entirely possible that his human mind never
 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 understand, because his brain was made of 
\emph on
old-fashioned linear-time neurons,
\emph default
 and this had turned out to be an impoverished subset of reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the plus side, the Comed-Tea, which had once seemed all-powerful and
 all-unbelievable, had turned out to have a much simpler explanation.
 Which he'd missed 
\emph on
merely
\emph default
 because the truth was completely outside his hypothesis space or anything
 that his brain had evolved to comprehend.
 But now he actually 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 figured it, probably.
 Which was sort of encouraging.
 Sort of.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry glanced down at his watch.
 It was nearly 11am, he'd gotten to sleep last night at 1am, so in the natural
 state of affairs he'd go to sleep tonight at 3am.
 So to go to sleep at 10pm and wake up at 7am, he should go back five hours
 total.
 Which meant that if he wanted to get back to his dorm at around 6am, before
 anyone was awake, he'd better hurry up and…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in 
\emph on
retrospect
\emph default
 Harry didn't understand how he'd pulled off 
\emph on
half
\emph default
 the stuff involved in the Prank.
 Where had the 
\emph on
pie
\emph default
 come from?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was starting to seriously fear time travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, he had to admit that it 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 been an irreplaceable opportunity.
 A prank you could only pull on yourself once in a lifetime, within six
 hours of when you first found out about Time-Turners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact that was even 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 puzzling, when Harry thought about it.
 Time had presented him with the finished Prank as a 
\emph on
fait accompli,
\emph default
 and yet it was, quite clearly, his own handiwork.
 Concept and execution and writing style.
 Every last part, even the ones he still didn't understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, time was a-wasting and there were at most thirty hours in a day.
 Harry did know 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of what he had to do, and he might figure out the rest, like the pie, while
 he was working.
 There was no point putting it off.
 He couldn't exactly accomplish anything stuck here in the 
\emph on
future.

Five hours earlier, Harry was sneaking into his dorm with his robes pulled
 up over his head as a thin sort of disguise, just in case someone was already
 up and about and saw him at the same time as Harry lying in his bed.
 He didn't want to have to explain to anyone about his little medical problem
 with Spontaneous Duplication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately it seemed that everyone was still asleep.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And there also seemed to be a box, wrapped in red and green paper with a
 bright golden ribbon, lying next to his bed.
 The perfect, stereotypical image of a Christmas present, although it wasn't
 Christmas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry crept in as softly as he could manage, just in case someone had their
 Quieter turned down low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was an envelope attached to the box, closed by plain clear wax without
 a seal impressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry carefully pried the envelope open, and took out the letter inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The letter said:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
This is the Cloak of Invisibility of Ignotus Peverell, passed down through
 his descendants the Potters.
 Unlike lesser cloaks and spells it has the power to keep you

 Your father lent it to me to study shortly before he died, and I confess
 that I have received much good use of it over the years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
In the future I shall have to get along with Disillusionment, I fear.
 It is time the Cloak was returned to you, its heir.
 I had thought to make this a Christmas present, but it wished to come back
 to your hand before then.
 It seems to expect you to have need of it.
 Use it well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
No doubt you are already thinking of all manner of wonderful pranks, as
 your father committed in his day.
 If his full misdeeds were known, every woman in Gryffindor would gather
 to desecrate his grave.
 I shall not try to stop history from repeating, but be MOST careful not
 to reveal yourself.
 If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows, he would
 never let it escape his grasp until the day he died.

“Hold on,” Harry said, pulling up short as the other boys were about to
 leave the Ravenclaw dorm.
 “Sorry, there's something else I've got to do with my trunk.

\begin_layout Standard
Terry Boot scowled at Harry.
 “You'd better not be planning to go through any of our things.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry held up one hand.
 “I swear that I intend to do nothing of the sort to any of your things,
 that I only intend to access objects that I myself own, that I have no
 pranking or otherwise questionable intentions towards any of you, and that
 I do not anticipate those intentions changing before I get to breakfast

\end_layout

“Understood,” said Harry, swallowing hard.
 “Um, shouldn't you tell students all that sort of stuff right away?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Penelope sighed.
 “What,

all

 of it? That would take weeks.
 You'll pick it up as you go along.” She turned to go, followed by the other
 students.
 “If I don't see you at breakfast in thirty minutes, Potter, I'll start
 the search.”

 he'd already written it and all the other notes, working in his cavern

 Then he carefully reached inside the Quietus field and pulled the Cloak
 of Invisibility off Harry-1's still-sleeping form.

And just for the sake of mischief, Harry put the Cloak into Harry-1's pouch,
