am on Thursday morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was sitting on his bed, a textbook lying limp in his motionless hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had just had an idea for a 
\emph on
truly brilliant
\emph default
 experimental test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was why he had
 cereal bars.
 No, this idea absolutely positively had to be tested right away, immediately,
 now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his bed, yanked
 out the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs, and started moving
 boxes of books around.
 (He really needed to unpack and get bookcases at some point but he was
 in the middle of his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling
 behind so he hadn't had time.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry found the book he wanted and raced back upstairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the Great Hall
 and start the day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse me can you do something for me?” said Harry.
 He was flipping through the book's index as he spoke, found the page with
 the first ten thousand primes, flipped to that page, and thrust the book
 at Anthony Goldstein.
 “Pick two three-digit numbers from this list.
 Don't tell me what they are.
 Just multiply them together and tell me the product.
 Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to double-check? Please make really
 sure you've got the right answer, I'm not sure what's going to happen to
 me or the universe if you make a multiplication error.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over the past few
 days that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything like “Why'd you suddenly
 flip out?” or “That seems really weird, what are your reasons for asking?”
 or “What do you mean, you're not sure what's going to happen to the universe?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment and quill.
 Harry spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to see anything, dancing
 back and forth and bouncing up and down with impatience.
 He got a pad of paper and a mechanical pencil and got ready to write.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Okay,” Anthony said, “One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four hundred
 and twenty-nine.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry wrote down 181,429.
 He repeated what he'd just written down, and Anthony confirmed it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk, glanced at
 his watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and then shut his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps, followed by
 the sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding shut.
 (Harry wasn't worried about suffocating.
 An automatic Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you were
 willing to buy a really good trunk.
 Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have to worry about electric bills.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been hoping to see,
 a folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift of his future self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call that piece of paper “Paper-2”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry tore a piece of paper off his pad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Call that “Paper-1”.
 It was, of course, the same piece of paper.
 You could even see, if you looked closely, that the ragged edges matched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry reviewed in his mind the algorithm that he would follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write “101 x
 101” down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back in time, drop
 off Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and head on up out of
 the cavern level to join his dorm mates for breakfast.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it had two numbers written on it, Harry would
 multiply those numbers together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If their product equaled 181,429, Harry would write down those two numbers
 on Paper-1 and send Paper-1 back in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write down the
 new pair of numbers on Paper-1.
 Unless that made the number on the right greater than 997, in which case
 Harry would add 2 to the number on the left and write down 101 on the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1 blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which meant that the only possible 
\emph on
stable
\emph default
 time loop was the one in which Paper-2 contained the two prime factors
 of 181,429.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer that was
 easy to check but hard to find.
 He wouldn't have 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 shown that P=NP once you had a Time-Turner, this trick was 
\emph on
more general
\emph default
 than that.
 Harry could use it to find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords
 of every sort.
 Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets, if Harry
 could figure out some systematic way of describing all the locations in
 Hogwarts.
 It would be an awesome cheat even by Harry's standards of cheating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took Paper-2 in his trembling hand, and unfolded it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paper-2 said in slightly shaky handwriting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DO NOT MESS WITH TIME
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry wrote down “DO NOT MESS WITH TIME” on Paper-1 in slightly shaky handwritin
g, folded it neatly, and resolved not to do any more truly brilliant experiments
 on Time until he was at least fifteen years old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest experimental
 result in the entire history of science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had been somewhat difficult for Harry to focus on reading his textbook
 for the next hour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was how Harry's Thursday started.

\begin_layout Standard
Thursday.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wanted to be specific, 3:32pm on Thursday afternoon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a grassy
 field with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply of broomsticks.
 The girls would be learning to fly separately.
 Apparently, for some reason, girls didn't want to learn how to fly on broomstic
ks in the presence of boys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had been a little wobbly all day long.
 He just couldn't seem to stop wondering how that 
\emph on
particular
\emph default
 stable time loop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather
 large space of possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also: seriously, 
\emph on
broomsticks?
\emph default
 He was going to fly on, basically, a line segment? Wasn't that pretty much
 the single most unstable shape you could possibly find, short of attempting
 to hold on to a point marble? Who'd selected 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 design for a flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry had been
 hoping that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing
 in front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen
 broomsticks.
 Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of broomsticks and failed to
 consider anything else? It had to be.
 There was no way that the 
\emph on
optimal
\emph default
 designs for cleaning kitchens and flying would happen to coincide if you
 worked them out from scratch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun that was just
 begging to get in your eyes and make it impossible to see, if you were
 trying to fly around the sky.
 The ground was nice and dry, smelling positively baked, and somehow felt
 very, very hard under Harry's shoes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry kept reminding himself that the lowest common denominator of elev\SpecialChar \-
en-year-o
lds was expected to learn this and it couldn't be that hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Stick out your right hand over the broom, or left hand if you're left-handed,”
 called Madam Hooch.
 “And say, UP!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“UP!” everyone shouted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The broomstick leapt eagerly into Harry's hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which put him at the head of the class, for once.
 Apparently saying “UP!” was a lot more difficult than it looked, and most
 of the broomsticks were rolling around on the ground or trying to inch
 away from their would-be riders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Of course Harry would have bet money that Hermione had done at least as
 well when it came her own turn to try, earlier in the day.
 There couldn't possibly be anything 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 could master on the first try which would baffle Hermione, and if there
 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 and it turned out to be 
\emph on
broomstick riding
\emph default
 instead of anything intellectual, Harry would just die.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of them.
 Madam Hooch showed them how to mount and then walked around the field,
 correcting grips and stances.
 Apparently even among the few children who'd been allowed to fly at home,
 they hadn't been taught to do it correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Madam Hooch surveyed the field of boys, and nodded.
 “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed hard, trying to quell the queasy feeling in his stomach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down
 by leaning forwards slightly.

One of the brooms shot skyward, accompanied by a young boy's screams

\begin_layout Standard
As though in slow motion, Harry was leaping back off his own broomstick
 and scrabbling for his wand, though he didn't really know what he planned
 to do with it, he'd had exactly two sessions of Charms and the last one
 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 been the Hover Charm but Harry had only been able to cast the spell successfull

“Come back, boy!” shouted Madam Hooch (which had to be the most unhelpful
 instruction imaginable for dealing with an out-of-control broomstick, from
 a 
\emph on
flying instructor
\emph default
, and a fully automatic section of Harry's brain added Madam Hooch to his
 tally of fools).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the boy was thrown off the broomstick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He seemed to move very slowly through the air, at first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Wingardium Leviosa!

” screamed Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spell failed.
 He could feel it fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a THUD and a distant cracking sound, and the boy lay facedown
 on the grass in a heap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed.
 He arrived at the boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and Harry
 reached into his pouch and tried to recall oh god what was the name never
 mind he'd just try “Healer's Pack!” and it popped up into his hand and

\begin_layout Standard
“Broken wrist,” Madam Hooch said.
 “Calm down, boy, he just has a broken wrist!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a sort of mental lurch as Harry's mind snapped out of Panic Mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and there was
 a syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would have kept the boy's
 brain oxygenated if he'd managed to snap his neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah…” Harry said in a rather wavering sort of voice.
 His heart was pounding so loudly that he almost couldn't hear himself panting
 for breath.
 “Broken bone… right… Setting String?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's for emergencies only,” snapped Madam Hooch.
 “Put it away, he's fine.” She leaned over the boy, offering him a hand.
 “Come on, boy, it's all right, up you get!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You're not seriously going to make him ride the broomstick again?” Harry
 said in horror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare.
 “Of course not!” She pulled the boy to his feet using his good arm

 Harry saw with a shock that it was Neville Longbottom

 and she turned to all the watching children.
 “None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
 leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you
 can say `Quidditch.' Come on, dear.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Madam Hooch walked off with Neville, who was clutching his wrist and
 trying to control his sniffles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they were out of earshot, one of the Slytherins started giggling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That set off the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned and looked at them.
 It seemed like a good time to memorise some faces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied by Mr.

Crabbe and Mr.

 Mr.

Crabbe wasn't smiling.
 Mr.

Goyle decidedly was.
 Draco himself was wearing a very controlled face that twitched occasionally,
 from which Harry inferred that Draco thought it was hilarious but saw no
 political advantage to be gained by laughing about it now instead of in
 the Slytherin dungeons afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, Potter,” Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry, still with
 that very controlled face that was twitching occasionally, “Just wanted
 to say, when you take advantage of emergencies to demonstrate leadership,
 you want to look like you're in total control of the situation, rather
 than, say, going into a complete panic.” Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling look.
 “But you probably scored a few points anyway.
 You need any help stowing that healer's kit?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face turned
 away from Draco.
 “I think I'm fine,” Harry said.
 He put the syringe back in its place, redid the latches, and stood up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernie Macmillan arrived just as Harry was feeding the pack back into his
 mokeskin pouch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you, Harry Potter, on behalf of Hufflepuff,” Ernie Macmillan said
 formally.
 “It was a good try and a good thought.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“A good thought indeed,” drawled Draco.
 “Why didn't anyone in Hufflepuff have their wands out? Maybe if you'd 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 helped instead of just Potter, you could've caught him.
 I thought Hufflepuffs were supposed to stick together?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernie looked like he was torn between getting angry and wanting to die of
 shame.
 “We didn't think of it in time 
\begin_inset ERT

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah,” said Draco, “didn't 
\emph on
think
\emph default
 of it, I guess that's why it's better to have one Ravenclaw as a friend
 than all of Hufflepuff.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, hell, how was Harry supposed to juggle this one… “You're not helping,”
 Harry said in a mild tone.
 Hoping Draco would interpret that as 
\emph on
you're interfering with my plans, please shut up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hey, what's this?” said Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

Goyle.
 He stooped to the grass and picked up something around the size of a large
 marble, a glass ball that seemed to be filled with a swirling white mist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ernie blinked.
 “Neville's Remembrall!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What's a Remembrall?” asked Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It turns red if you've forgotten something,” Ernie said.
 “It doesn't tell you what you forgot, though.
 Give it here, please, and I'll hand it back to Neville later.” Ernie held
 out his hand.

\begin_layout Standard
A sudden grin flashed across Mr.

 “That sounds interesting.
 What sort of contest, Potter?”

Er…

“Contest” had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten.
 What sort of contest, he couldn't say “chess” because Draco wouldn't be

“How about this?” Harry said loudly.
 “Gregory Goyle and I stand apart from each other, and no one else is allowed
 to come near either of us.
 We don't use our wands and neither does anyone else.
 I don't move from where I'm standing, and neither does he.
 And if I can get my hands on Neville's Remembrall, then Gregory Goyle relinquis
hes all claim to that Remembrall he's holding and gives it to me.”

There was another pause as people's looks of relief transmuted to confusion.

Harry let the silence stretch on for a while, developing, until…

“Um, yeah,” said the boy, a Gryffindor (Dean something?).

Dean something kneeled down and began to scoop away dirt.

After a minute or so, Dean stood up again.
 “There's nothing there,” Dean said.

 Harry had been planning to go back in time and bury a treasure map that

No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office to the

Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, had asked Professor Flitwick if the

Professor Flitwick had shrugged in a helpless sort of way.

Apparently Dumbledore had said that Harry was far too young to invoke the

Potter,” squeaked Professor Flitwick from somewhere around Harry's shoulder
 level.
 (Harry was grateful for Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was
 hard getting used to a Professor who was not only shorter than him but
 spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) “Headmaster Dumbledore may seem a little
 odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he has never hurt a student
 in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will.” Professor Flitwick
 gave Harry an encouraging smile.
 “Just keep that in mind at all times and you'll be sure not to panic!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was not helping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Good luck!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the gargoyle
 and said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at all.
 (Of course, the password wouldn't be much good if you could hear someone
 saying it.) And the stone gargoyle walked aside with a very natural and
 ordinary movement that Harry found rather shocking, since the gargoyle
 still looked like solid, immovable stone the whole time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind the gargoyle was a set of slowly revolving spiral stairs.
 There was something disturbingly hypnotic about it, and even more disturbing

 the spiral ought not to take you anywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Up you go!” squeaked Flitwick.

Harry rather nervously stepped onto the spiral, and found himself, for some
 reason that his brain couldn't seem to visualise at all, moving upwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gargoyle thudded back into place behind him, and the spiral stairs kept
 turning and Harry kept being higher up, and after a rather dizzying time,
 Harry found himself in front of an oak door with a brass griffin knocker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry reached out and turned the doorknob.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door swung open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry saw the most interesting room he'd ever seen in his life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or slowly changed
 shape or emitted little puffs of smoke.
 There were dozens of mysterious fluids in dozens of oddly shaped containers,
 all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, or forming into interesting
 shapes that vanished half a second after you saw them.
 There were things that looked like clocks with many hands, inscribed with
 numbers or in unrecognisable languages.
 There was a bracelet bearing a lenticular crystal that sparkled with a
 thousand colors, and a bird perched atop a golden platform, and a wooden
 cup filled with what looked like blood, and a statue of a falcon encrusted
 in black enamel.
 The wall was all hung with pictures of people sleeping, and the Sorting
 Hat was casually poised on a hatrack that was also holding two umbrellas
 and three red slippers for left feet.

\begin_layout Standard
In the midst of all the chaos was a clean black oaken desk.
 Before the desk was an oaken stool.
 And behind the desk was a well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival
 Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, who was adorned with a long silver beard, a hat
 like a squashed giant mushroom, and what looked to Muggle eyes like three
 layers of bright pink pyjamas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was smiling, and his bright eyes twinkled with a mad intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With some trepidation, Harry seated himself in front of the desk.
 The door swung shut behind him with a loud 
\emph on
thunk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hello, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hello, Headmaster,” Harry replied.
 So they were on a first-name basis? Would Dumbledore now say to call him

 “Headmaster sounds so formal.

“I'll be sure to, Heh,” said Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a slight pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do you know,” said Dumbledore, “you're the first person who's ever taken
 me up on that?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah…” Harry said.
 He tried to control his voice despite the sudden sinking feeling in his
 stomach.
 “I'm sorry, I, ah, Headmaster, you told me to do it so I did

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Heh, please!” said Dumbledore cheerfully.
 “And there's no call to be so worried, I won't launch you out a window
 just because you make one mistake.
 I'll give you plenty of warnings first, if you're doing something wrong!
 Besides, what matters isn't how people talk to you, it's what they think
 of you.”

He's never hurt a student, just keep remembering that and you'll be sure

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open, showing some
 small yellow lumps.
 “Sherbet lemon?” said the Headmaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Er, no thank you, Heh,” said Harry.
 
\emph on
Does slipping a student LSD count as hurting them, or does that fall into
 the category of harmless fun?
\emph default
 “You, um, said something about my being too young to invoke the words of
 power and madness?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That you most certainly are!” Dumbledore said.
 “Thankfully the Words of Power and Madness were lost seven centuries ago
 and no one has the slightest idea what they are anymore.
 It was just a little remark.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah…” Harry said.
 He was aware that his mouth was hanging open.
 “Why did you call me here, then?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Why?
\emph default
” Dumbledore repeated.
 “Ah, Harry, if I went around all day asking 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 I do things, I'd never have time to get a single thing done! I'm quite
 a busy person, you know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded, smiling.
 “Yes, it was a very impressive list.
 Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump
 of the International Confederation of Wizards.
 Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it possible to get more than six hours
 if you use more than one Time-Turner? Because it's pretty impressive if
 you're doing all that on just thirty hours a day.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on smiling.
 He was a little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive, but once it
 had become clear that Dumbledore was deliberately messing with him, something
 within him 
\emph on
absolutely refused
\emph default
 to sit and take it like a defenceless lump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much,” said Dumbledore
 after the slight pause, “and yet we ourselves seem to be a little too large
 for it, and so it's a constant struggle to fit our lives into Time.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” Harry said with grave solemnity.
 “That's why it's best to come to our points quickly.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment Harry wondered if he'd gone too far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Dumbledore chuckled.
 “Straight to the point it shall be.” The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting
 his squashed mushroom hat and brushing his beard against his desk.
 “Harry, this Monday you did something that should have been impossible
 even with a Time-Turner.
 Or rather, impossible with 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 a Time-Turner.
 Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry.
 He'd done that using the Cloak of Invisibility, the one that had been given
 him in a Christmas box along with a note, and that note had said: 
\emph on
If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of the Deathly Hallows he would
 never let it escape his grasp.…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“A natural thought,” Dumbledore went on, “is that since none of the first-years
 present were able to cast such a spell, someone else was present, and yet
 unseen.
 And if no one could see them, why, it would be easy enough for them to
 throw the pies.
 One might further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you were the
 invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far beyond
 your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak.” Dumbledore smiled
 conspiratorially.
 “Am I on the right track so far, Harry?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was frozen.
 He had the feeling that an outright lie would not at all be wise, and possibly
 not the least bit helpful, and he couldn't think of anything else to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore waved a friendly hand.
 “Don't worry, Harry, you haven't done anything wrong.
 Invisibility cloaks aren't against the rules 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 I suppose they're rare enough that no one ever got around to putting them
 on the list.
 But really I was wondering something else entirely.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh?” Harry said in the most normal voice he could manage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm.
 “You see, Harry, after you've been through a few adventures you tend to
 catch the hang of these things.
 You start to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the world.
 You begin to harbour suspicions 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the moment of revelation.
 You are the Boy-Who-Lived, and somehow an invisibility cloak made its way
 into your hands only four days after you discovered our magical Britain.
 Such cloaks are not for sale in Diagon Alley, but there is 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 which might find its own way to a destined wearer.
 And so I cannot help but wonder if by some strange chance you have found
 not just 
\emph on
an
\emph default
 invisibility cloak, but 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 Cloak of Invisibility, one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to
 hide the wearer from the gaze of Death himself.” Dumbledore's gaze was bright
 and eager.
 “May I see it, Harry?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed.
 There was a full flood of adrenaline in his system now and it was entirely
 useless, this was the most powerful wizard in the world and there was no
 way he could make it out the door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for
 him to hide if he did, he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed
 down through the Potters for who knew how long

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair.
 The bright light had gone out of his eyes, and he looked puzzled and a
 little sorrowful.
 “Harry,” said Dumbledore, “if you don't want to, you can just say no.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can?” Harry croaked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
 His voice sounded sad now, and worried.
 “It seems that you're afraid of me, Harry.
 May I ask what I've done to earn your distrust?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed.
 “Is there some way you can swear a binding magical oath that you won't
 take my cloak?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore shook his head slowly.
 “Unbreakable Vows are not to be used so lightly.
 And besides, Harry, if you did not already know the spell, you would have
 only my word that the spell was binding.
 Yet surely you realise that I do not 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 your permission to see the Cloak.
 I am powerful enough to draw it forth myself, mokeskin pouch or no.” Dumbledore'
s face was very grave.
 “But this I will not do.
 The Cloak is yours, Harry.
 I will not seize it from you.
 Not even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to show it to
 me.
 That is a promise and an oath.
 Should I need to prohibit you from using it on the school grounds, I will
 require you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it there.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah…” Harry said.
 He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood of adrenaline and think reasonably.
 He took the mokeskin pouch off his belt.
 “If you really 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 need my permission… then you have it.” Harry held out the pouch to Dumbledore,
 and bit down hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in case he
 was Obliviated afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard reached into the pouch, and without saying any word of retrieval,
 drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah,” breathed Dumbledore.
 “I was right…” He poured the shimmering black velvet mesh through his hand.
 “Centuries old, and still as perfect as the day it was made.
 We have lost much of our art over the years, and now I cannot make such
 a thing myself, no one can.
 I can feel the power of it like an echo in my mind, like a song forever
 being sung without anyone to hear it…” The wizard looked up from the Cloak.
 “Do not sell it,” he said, “do not give it to anyone as a possession.
 Think twice before you show it to anyone, and ponder three times again
 before you reveal it is a Deathly Hallow.
 Treat it with respect, for this is indeed a Thing of Power.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…and then he handed the Cloak back to Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry put it back in his pouch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore's face was grave once more.
 “May I ask again, Harry, how you came to distrust me so?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There was a note with the Cloak,” Harry said in a small voice.
 “It said that you would try to take the Cloak from me, if you knew.
 I don't know who left the note, though, I really don't.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I… see,” Dumbledore said slowly.
 “Well, Harry, I won't impugn the motives of whoever left you that note.
 Who knows but that they themselves may have had the best of good intentions?
 They did give you the Cloak, after all.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded, impressed by Dumbledore's charity, and abashed at the sharp
 contrast with his own attitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard went on.
 “But you and I are both gamepieces of the same color, I think.
 The boy who finally defeated Voldemort, and the old man who held him off
 long enough for you to save the day.
 I will not hold your caution against you, Harry, we must all do our best
 to be wise.
 I will only ask that you think twice and ponder three times again, the
 next time someone tells you to distrust me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm sorry,” Harry said.
 He felt wretched at this point, he'd just told off Gandalf essentially,
 and Dumbledore's kindness was only making him feel worse.
 “I shouldn't have distrusted you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Alas, Harry, in this world…” The old wizard shook his head.
 “I cannot even say you were unwise.
 You did not know me.
 And in truth there are some at Hogwarts who you would do well not to trust.
 Perhaps even some you call friends.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry swallowed.
 That sounded rather ominous.
 “Like who?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore stood up from his chair, and began examining one of his instruments,
 a dial with eight hands of varying length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a few moments, the old wizard spoke again.
 “He probably seems to you quite charming,” said Dumbledore.
 “Polite

 “Oh no, no no no, you've got it all wrong, he's not turning me, I'm turning

 “You're

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm going to turn Draco Malfoy from the Dark Side,” Harry said.
 “You know, make him a good guy.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry.
 He was wearing one of the most astonished expressions Harry had ever seen
 on anyone, let alone someone with a long silver beard.
 “Are you certain,” said the old wizard after a moment, “that he is ready
 to be redeemed? I fear that whatever goodness you think you see within
 him is only wishful thinking

“Er, not likely,” Harry said.
 “I mean if he's trying to disguise himself as a good guy he's incredibly
 bad at it.
 This isn't a question of Draco coming up to me and being all charming and
 me deciding that he must have a hidden core of goodness deep down.
 I selected him for redemption specifically because he's the heir to House
 Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would obviously
 be him.”

Dumbledore's left eye twitched.
 “You intend to sow seeds of love and kindness in Draco Malfoy's heart because
 you expect Malfoy's heir to prove valuable to you?”

Dumbledore started laughing.
 Laughing a lot harder than Harry would expect, almost howling.
 It seemed positively

undignified.

\emph default
 An ancient and powerful wizard ought to chuckle in deep booming tones,
 not laugh so hard he was gasping for breath.
 Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while watching the Marx

 He was starting to worry about Dumbledore's sanity again.

Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort.
 “Ah, Harry, one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin
 laughing at things that no one else thinks is funny, because when you're

 from his eyes.
 “Ah, me.
 Ah, me.
 Oft evil will shall evil mar indeed, in very deed.”

Harry's brain took a moment to place the familiar words… “Hey, that's a

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid not,” said Dumbledore, smiling again.
 “I was born seventy years before that book was published, dear child.
 But it seems that my Muggleborn students tend to think alike in certain
 ways.
 I have accumulated no fewer than twenty copies of 
\emph on
The Lord of the Rings

 “

 How does that look?”

“Ah,” Harry said in something approaching complete brain shutdown, “I think
 you're missing a Balrog.” And the pink pyjamas and squashed mushroom hat
 were not helping in the slightest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see.” Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his belt.
 “I fear there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of late.
 Nowadays it's all meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try desperately
 to prevent any work from getting done, and formal dinners where foreign
 politicians compete to see who can be the most obstinate fool.
 And being mysterious at people, knowing things I have no way of knowing,
 making cryptic statements which can only be understood in hindsight, and
 all the other small ways in which powerful wizards amuse themselves after
 they have left the part of the pattern that allows them to be heroes.
 Speaking of which, Harry, I have a certain something to give you, something
 which belonged to your father.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You do?” said Harry.
 “Gosh, who would have figured.”

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore.
 “I suppose it is a little predictable, isn't it?” His face turned solemn.
 “Nonetheless…”

Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one of the drawers
 as he did so.
 He reached in using both arms, and, straining slightly, pulled a rather
 large and heavy-looking object out of the drawer, which he then deposited

 It was light gray, discolored, irregularly shaped, sharp-edged, and very

 Dumbledore had deposited it so that it rested on the widest available cross-sec

\end_layout

Harry looked up.
 “This is a joke, right?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It is not,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very serious.
 “I took this from the ruins of James and Lily's home in Godric's Hollow,
 where also I found you; and I have kept it from then until now, against

 “Um, is it a

 rock?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not so far as I know,” said Dumbledore.
 “But I advise you with the greatest possible stringency to keep it close

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All right.
 Dumbledore was 
\emph on
probably

 insane but if he

Harry stepped forward and put his hands on the rock, trying to find some
 angle from which to lift it without cutting himself.
 “I'll put it in my pouch, then.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore frowned.
 “That may not be close enough to your person.
 And what if your mokeskin pouch is lost, or stolen?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You think I should just carry a big rock everywhere I go?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore gave Harry a serious look.
 “That might prove wise.”

“Ah…” Harry said.
 It looked rather heavy.
 “I'd think the other students would tend to ask me questions about that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Tell them I ordered you to do it,” said Dumbledore.
 “No one will question that, since they all think I'm insane.” His face was
 still perfectly serious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Er, to be honest if you go around ordering your students to carry large
 rocks I can kind of see why people would think that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
 The old wizard gestured, a sweep of one hand that seemed to take in all
 the mysterious instruments around the room.
 “When we are young we believe that we know everything, and so we believe
 that if we see no explanation for something, then no explanation exists.
 When we are older we realise that the whole universe works by a rhythm
 and a reason, even if we ourselves do not know it.
 It is only our own ignorance which appears to us as insanity.”

Dumbledore nodded.
 “But just because I can't think of a reason doesn't mean there

 no reason.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The instruments ticked on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Okay,” said Harry, “I'm not even sure if I should be saying this, but that

 the universe works.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It isn't?” said the old wizard, looking surprised and disappointed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work out in his
 favour, but he carried on regardless.
 “No.
 I don't even know if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to
 make one up myself, it would be `privileging the hypothesis' or something
 like that.
 How can I put this formally… um… suppose you had a million boxes, and only
 one of the boxes contained a diamond.
 And you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector
 always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the time
 on boxes that didn't have a diamond.
 If you ran twenty detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average,
 one false candidate and one true candidate left.
 And then it would just take one or two more detectors before you were left
 with the one true candidate.
 The point being that when there are lots of possible answers,

 bringing it to your attention in the first place.
 The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three plausible
 candidates is much smaller by comparison.
 So if you just jump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibili
ty to the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the work.
 Like, you live in a city where there are a million people, and there's
 a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no evidence at all, so
 have we considered the possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass did it?”

\begin_layout Standard
“Did he?” said Dumbledore.
\end_layout

“No,” said Harry.
 “But later it turns out that the murderer had black hair, and Mortimer

 Otherwise you can't just pluck the right answer out of thin air.
 You can't even pluck a possibility worth thinking about out of thin air.
 And there's got to be a million other things I could do besides carrying
 around my father's rock.
 Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't mean that I'm unsure
 about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty.
 The laws for thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the laws
 that govern old-fashioned logic, and what you just did is

 “

“Ah,” said Dumbledore.
 He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful.
 “An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at the point
 where you make an analogy between a million potential murderers only one
 of whom committed the murder, and taking one out of many possible courses
 of action, when many possible courses of action may all be wise? I do not
 say that carrying your father's rock is the one best possible course of
 action, only that it is wiser to do than not.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had accessed
 earlier, this time seeming to root around inside

\end_inset

 at least his arm seemed to be moving.
 “I will remark,” Dumbledore said while Harry was still trying to sort out
 how to reply to this completely unexpected rejoinder, “that it is a common
 misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there,
 leaving none for other Houses.
 This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw indicates that you are driven
 by your desire to know things, which is not at all the same quality as
 being intelligent.” The wizard was smiling as he bent over the drawer.
 “Nonetheless, you 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 seem rather intelligent.
 Less like an ordinary young hero and more like a young mysterious ancient
 wizard.
 I think I may have been taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and
 that you may be able to understand things that few others could grasp.
 So I shall be daring, and offer you a certain 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 heirloom.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You don't mean…” gasped Harry.
 “My father… 
\emph on
owned another rock?
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse me,” said Dumbledore, “I 
\emph on
am
\emph default
 still older and more mysterious than you and if there are any revelations
 to be made then 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 will do the revealing, thank you… oh, where 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 that thing!” Dumbledore reached down further into the desk drawer, and
 still further.
 His head and shoulders and whole torso disappeared inside until only his
 hips and legs were sticking out, as though the desk drawer was eating him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry couldn't help but wonder just how much stuff was in there and what
 the complete inventory would look like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally Dumbledore rose back up out of the drawer, holding the objective
 of his search, which he set down on the desk alongside the rock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook: 
\emph on
Intermediate Potion Making
\emph default
 by Libatius Borage.
 There was a picture of a smoking vial on the cover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This,” Dumbledore intoned, “was your mother's fifth-year Potions textbook.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Which I am to carry with me at all times,” said Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Which holds a terrible secret
\emph default
.
 A secret whose revelation could prove so disastrous that I must ask you

\end_inset

 never to tell anyone or anything else.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry considered his mother's fifth-year Potions textbook, which, apparently,
 held a terrible secret.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem was that Harry 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 take that oaths like that very seriously.
 Any vow was an Unbreakable Vow if made by the right sort of person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm feeling thirsty,” Harry said, “and that is not at all a good sign.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore entirely failed to ask any questions about this cryptic statement.
 “
\emph on
Do
\emph default
 you swear, Harry?” said Dumbledore.
 His eyes gazed intently into Harry's.
 “Otherwise I cannot tell you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” said Harry.
 “I swear.” That was the trouble with being a Ravenclaw.
 You couldn't refuse an offer like that or your curiosity would eat you
 alive, and everyone else knew it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And I swear in turn,” said Dumbledore, “that what I am about to tell you
 is the truth.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore opened the book, seemingly at random, and Harry leaned in to
 see.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do you see these notes,” Dumbledore said in a voice so low it was almost
 a whisper, “written in the margins of the book?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry squinted slightly.
 The yellowing pages seemed to be describing something called a 
\emph on
potion of eagle's splendour,
\emph default
 many of the ingredients being items that Harry didn't recognise at all
 and whose names didn't appear to derive from English.
 Scrawled in the margin was a handwritten annotation saying, 
\emph on
I wonder what would happen if you used Thestral blood here instead of blueberrie
s?
\emph default
 and immediately beneath was a reply in different handwriting, 
\emph on
You'd get sick for weeks and maybe die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see them,” said Harry.
 “What about them?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore pointed to the second scrawl.
 “The ones in this handwriting,” he said, still in that low voice, “were
 written by your mother.
 And the ones in 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 handwriting,” moving his finger to indicate the first scrawl, “were written
 by me.
 I would turn myself invisible and sneak into her dorm room while she was
 sleeping.
 Lily thought one of her friends was writing them and they had the most
 amazing fights.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the exact point at which Harry realised that the Headmaster of
 Hogwarts 
\emph on
was,
\emph default
 in fact, crazy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was looking at him with a serious expression.
 “Do you understand the implications of what I have just told you, Harry?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ehhh…” Harry said.
 His voice seemed to be stuck.
 “Sorry… I… not really…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah well,” said Dumbledore, and sighed.
 “I suppose your cleverness has limits after all, then.
 Shall we all just pretend I didn't say anything?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry rose from his chair, wearing a fixed smile.
 “Of course,” Harry said.
 “You know it's actually getting rather late in the day and I'm a bit hungry,
 so I should be going down to dinner, really” and Harry made a beeline for
 the door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The doorknob entirely failed to turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You wound me, Harry,” said Dumbledore's voice in quiet tones that were
 coming from right behind him.
 “Do you not at least realise that what I have told you is a sign of trust?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry slowly turned around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In front of him was a very powerful and very insane wizard with a long silver
 beard, a hat like a squashed giant mushroom, and wearing what looked to
 Muggle eyes like three layers of bright pink pyjamas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind him was a door that didn't seem to be working at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted to lean
 on a wizard's staff he didn't have.
 “Really,” said Dumbledore, “you try anything new instead of following the
 same pattern every time for a hundred and ten years, and people all start
 running away.” The old wizard shook his head in sorrow.
 “I'd hoped for better from you, Harry Potter.
 I'd heard that your own friends also think you mad.
 I know they are mistaken.
 Will you not believe the same of me?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please open the door,” Harry said, his voice trembling.
 “If you ever want me to trust you again, open the door.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was the sound behind him of a door opening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There were more things I planned to say to you,” Dumbledore said, “and
 if you leave now, you will not know what they were.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes Harry absolutely 
\emph on
hated
\emph default
 being a Ravenclaw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
He's never hurt a student,
\emph default
 said Harry's Gryffindor side.
 
\emph on
Just keep remembering that and you'll be sure not to panic.
 You're not going to run away just because things are getting interesting,
 are you?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You can't just walk out on the Headmaster!
\emph default
 said the Hufflepuff part.
 
\emph on
What if he starts deducting House points? He could make your school life
 very difficult if he decides he doesn't like you!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't quite manage
 to silence was pondering the potential advantages of being one of the few
 friends of this mad old wizard who also happened to be Headmaster, Chief
 Warlock, and Supreme Mugwump.
 And unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better than Draco
 at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying things like 
\emph on
poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk to, doesn't he?
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
you wouldn't want such a powerful man to end up trusting someone less virtuous,
 would you?
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
I wonder what sort of incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell you if, you
 know, you became friends with him
\emph default
 and even 
\emph on
I bet he's got a reaallly interesting book collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
You're all a bunch of lunatics,
\emph default
 Harry thought at the entire assemblage, but he'd been unanimously outvoted
 by every component part of himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned, took a step towards the open door, reached out, and deliberately
 closed it again.
 It was a costless sacrifice given that he was staying anyway, Dumbledore
 could control his movements regardless, but maybe it would impress Dumbledore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Harry turned back around he saw that the powerful insane wizard was
 once more smiling and looking friendly.
 That was good, maybe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please don't do that again,” Harry said.
 “I don't like being trapped.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I 
\emph on
am
\emph default
 sorry about that, Harry,” said Dumbledore in what sounded like tones of
 sincere apology.
 “But it would have been terribly unwise to let you leave without your father's
 rock.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course,” Harry said.
 “It wasn't reasonable of me to expect the door to open before I put the
 quest items in my inventory.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore smiled and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry went over to the desk, twisted his mokeskin pouch around to the front
 of his belt, and, with some effort, managed to heave up the rock in his
 eleven-year-old arms and feed it in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He could actually feel the weight slowly diminishing as the Widening Lip
 charm ate the rock, and the burp which followed was rather noisy and had
 a distinctly complaining sound to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held a secret that was in
 fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Harry's inner Slytherin made a sly suggestion for ingratiating
 himself with the Headmaster, which, unfortunately, had been perfectly pitched
 in such a way as to gain the support of the majority Ravenclaw faction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So,” Harry said.
 “Um.
 As long as I'm hanging around, I don't suppose you would like to give me
 a bit of a tour of your office? I'm a bit curious as to what some of these
 things are,” and that was his understatement for the month of September.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin.
 “I'm flattered by your interest,” said Dumbledore, “but I'm afraid there
 isn't much to say.” Dumbledore took a step closer to the wall and pointed
 to a painting of a sleeping man.
 “These are portraits of past Headmasters of Hogwarts.” He turned and pointed
 to his desk.
 “This is my desk.” He pointed to his chair.
 “This is my chair

\begin_layout Standard
“Excuse me,” Harry said, “actually I was wondering about those.” Harry pointed
 to a small cube that was softly whispering “blorple… blorple… blorple”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh, the little fiddly things?” said Dumbledore.
 “They came with the Headmaster's office and I have absolutely no idea what
 most of them do.
 Although 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 dial with the eight hands counts the number of, let's call them sneezes,
 by left-handed witches within the borders of France, you would not believe
 how much work it took to nail that down.
 And 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 one with the golden wibblers is my own invention and Minerva is never,
 ever going to figure out what it's doing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore took a step over to the hatrack while Harry was still processing
 this.
 “Here of course we have the Sorting Hat, I believe the two of you have
 met.
 It told me that it was never again to be placed on your head under any
 circumstances.
 You're only the fourteenth student in history it's said that about, Baba
 Yaga was another one and I'll tell you about the other twelve when you're
 older.
 This is an umbrella.
 This is another umbrella.” Dumbledore took another few steps and turned
 around, now smiling quite broadly.
 “And of course, most people who come to my office want to see Fawkes.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was standing next to the bird on the golden platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry came over, rather puzzled.
 “This is Fawkes?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fawkes is a phoenix,” said Dumbledore.
 “Very rare, very powerful magical creatures.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah…” Harry said.
 He lowered his head and stared into the tiny, beady black eyes, which showed
 not the slightest sign of power or intelligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ahhh…” Harry said again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was pretty sure he recognised the shape of the bird.
 It was pretty hard to miss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Umm…”
\end_layout

Well what the heck am I
\emph default
 supposed

 Harry's mind fired back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Anything!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Yes! Anything but that!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So, ah, what sort of magic do phoenixes do, then?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Their tears have the power to heal,” Dumbledore said.
 “They are creatures of fire, and move between all places as easily as fire
 may extinguish itself in one place and be kindled in another.
 The tremendous strain of their innate magic ages their bodies quickly,
 and yet they are as close to undying as any creature that exists in this
 world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate themselves in
 a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or sometimes an egg.” Dumbledore
 came closer and inspected the chicken, frowning.
 “Hm… looking a little peaky there, I'd say.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time this statement registered fully in Harry's mind, the chicken
 was already on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chicken's beak opened, but it didn't have time for so much as a single
 caw before it began to wither and char.
 The blaze was brief, intense, and entirely self-contained; there was no
 smell of burning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the fire died down only seconds after it had begun, leaving behind
 a tiny, pathetic heap of ashes on the golden platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Don't look so horrified, Harry!” said Dumbledore.
 “Fawkes hasn't been hurt.” Dumbledore's hand dipped into a pocket, and then
 the same hand sifted through the ashes and turned up a small yellowish
 egg.
 “Look, here's an egg!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh… wow… amazing…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But now we really should get on with things,” Dumbledore said.
 Leaving the egg behind in the ashes of the chicken, he returned to his
 throne and seated himself.
 “It's almost time for dinner, after all, and we wouldn't want to have to
 use our Time-Turners.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a violent power struggle going on in the Government of Harry.
 Slytherin and Hufflepuff had switched sides after seeing the Headmaster
 of Hogwarts set fire to a chicken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, things,” said Harry's lips.
 “And then dinner.”

 A confession and an apology.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Apologies are good” 
\emph on
that doesn't even make sense! What am I talking about?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard sighed deeply.
 “You may not still think so after understanding what I have to say.
 I'm afraid, Harry, that I've been manipulating you your entire life.
 It was I who consigned you to the care of your wicked stepparents

“They aren't?” Dumbledore said, looking surprised and disappointed.
 “Not even a little wicked? That doesn't fit the pattern…”

Harry's inner Slytherin screamed at the top of its mental lungs, 
\emph on
SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!

“No, no,” said Harry, lips frozen in a ghastly grimace, “I was just trying

“Yes, I'm very angry!” said Harry.
 “Grrr!”

Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded him the All-Time Award for the

“And I just wanted you to know,” Dumbledore said, “I wanted to tell you

Moisture glistened in the old wizard's eyes.

“I see,” said Professor McGonagall, her voice a little calmer.
 She stood up, brushed herself off, and glared at the scattered parchments,
