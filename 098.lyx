 Greengrass walked quietly toward the Greengrass room below the Slytherin
 dungeons, the privilege of an Ancient House; on her way to drop off her
 trunk from the Hogwarts Express, before she joined the other students for
 dinner.
 The whole private area had been hers alone ever since Malfoy had gone.
 Her hand, held behind her, made repeated come-along gestures at her huge
 emerald-studded trunk, which seemed hesitant to follow.
 Maybe the enchantments on the sturdy old family device needed to be reapplied;
 or maybe her trunk was reluctant to follow her into Hogwarts, which was
 no longer safe.

There'd been a long talk between Mother and Father, after they'd been told
 about Hermione; with Daphne hiding around a doorway to listen, choking
 back her tears and trying not to make sounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mother had said that the sad fact was that if only one student died every
 year, well, that still made Hogwarts safer than Beauxbatons, let alone
 Durmstrang.
 There were more ways for a young witch to die than being murdered.
 Beauxbatons's Transfiguration Master just wasn't on the same level as McGonagal
l, Mother had said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Father had soberly remarked how important it was for the Greengrass heir
 to stay at Hogwarts where all the other Noble families sent their children
 to school (it was the reason for the old tradition of the Noble families
 synchronizing the birth of their heirs, to put them in the same year of
 Hogwarts, if they could).
 And Father had said that being heiress to a Most Ancient House meant you
 couldn't always stay away from trouble.

She could have done without hearing that last part.

Daphne gulped hard, as she turned the doorknob, and opened the door.

Draco Malfoy smiled, metallic robes gleaming in the light of his full corporeal

 into a pair of leather pants was beneath his concerns.
 “Yes,” said Draco, “but it doesn't matter now.
 House Malfoy is returning House Potter's money and cancelling the debt.”

Daphne walked over to her bed and then fell on it, hoping she could wake

Harry Potter had, apparently, taken to being invisible; they'd glimpsed
 his hand only briefly, when he was handing them the list, written on strange
 not-parchment.
 Harry had explained that, all things considered, he didn't really think
 it was smart for him to be 
\emph on
findable
\emph default
 except on special occasions, so he was just going to deal with people as
 a disembodied floating voice from now on, or as a brilliant silver light
 that hid behind corners where nobody could see it, and which could always
 find his friends no matter where they tried to hide.
 It was, in all honesty, one of the creepiest things which Fred and George
 had ever heard, over a lifetime which had included filling the shoes of
 every student in second-year Slytherin with Transfigured live millipedes.
 Fred and George didn't think this could possibly be good for anyone's sanity,
 but they didn't know what to say.
 It couldn't be denied, they'd seen with their own four eyes, that Hogwarts…

“I don't know who you went to for the False Memory Charm on Rita Skeeter,”
 said the sourceless voice of Harry Potter.
 “Whoever it is… probably 
\emph on
won't
\emph default
 be able to fill this order directly, but they may know someone who can
 get things from the Muggle world.
 And -- I know it may cost extra, but as few people as possible should know
 that Harry Potter is related to this.” Another flash of a small boy's hand,
 and a bag hit the ground with the clinking noise.
 “Some of these items are expensive even in the Muggle world, and your contact
 may have to go outside Britain; but one hundred Galleons will be enough
 to pay for it all, I hope.
 I'd tell you where the Galleons came from, but I don't want to spoil tomorrow's
 surprise.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What 
\emph on
is

 this stuff?” said Fred or George, as they looked over the list.
 “Our father is a Muggle expert

“Things have become serious,” Harry's voice said softly.
 “I don't know what I'll have to do.
 I may need the power of the Muggles, not just the wizards, before this
 is done -- and I might need it right away, with no time to prepare.
 I'm not
\emph on
 planning
\emph default
 to use any of this.
 I just want it around in case of… contingencies.” Harry's voice paused.
 “Obviously I owe you more than I can ever repay and you won't 
\emph on
let
\emph default
 me give you
\emph on
 any
\emph default
 of what you deserve, I don't even know how to say thank you properly, and
 all I can do is hope that someday when you grow up you'll be more sensible
 about this whole thing and would you

“Shut up, you,” said George or Fred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“For God's sake, you went after a troll for me and Fred had his ribs broken!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They both just shook their heads.
 Harry had stayed behind when they'd told him to run, and stepped forward
 to distract the troll from eating George.
 Harry was the kind of person, they knew, who'd think that something like
 that didn't cancel out what he owed the Weasley twins, that his own deed
 wasn't properly commensurate.
 But what the Weasleys knew, and Harry wouldn't understand until he was
 older, was that it meant that nothing was owed, or ever could be owed between
 them.
 It was a strange kind of selfishness, they thought, that Harry could understand
 kindness within himself -- never dreaming of asking of money from anyone
 he'd helped more than they'd helped him, or calling that a debt -- while
 being apparently unable to conceive that others might want to act the same
 way toward

Shortly after the dessert dishes had appeared, a student stood up from the

“First!” Daphne said.
 Daphne was trying to keep her trembling under control, as she faced the
 Four Houses at the forefront of the five.
 There was only so far her parents' lessons in speech-making could take
 her.
 Daphne's eyes darted down quickly to her hand, upon which, written with
 a quill in faint red ink, cues to her lines had been written.
 “Students are not to go anywhere alone, not even to the toilets! You will
 travel in groups of at least three, and every group must have a sixth-year

 Malfoy had apparently memorized his own lines, since there was nothing
