LORD OF THE RATIONALITY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him.
 All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought.
 A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some
 doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be
 spoken.
 An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in
 Rivendell filled all his heart.
 At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as
 if some other will was using his small voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We cannot,” said Frodo.
 “We must not.
 Do you not see? It is exactly what the Enemy desires.
 All of this he has foreseen.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The faces turned to him, puzzled the Dwarves and grave the Elves; sternness
 in the eyes of the Men; and so keen the gazes of Elrond and of Gandalf
 that Frodo almost could not withstand it.
 It was very hard, then, not to grasp the Ring in his hand, and harder still
 not to put it on, to face them as only Frodo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do you not question it?” Frodo said, thin like the wind his voice, and
 wavering like a breeze.
 “You have chosen, of all things, to send the Ring into Mordor; should you
 not wonder? How did it come to this? That we might, of all our choices,
 do that single thing our Enemy most desires? Perhaps the Cracks of Doom
 are already guarded, strongly enough to hold off Gandalf and Elrond and
 Glorfindel all together; or perhaps the Master of that place has cooled
 the lava there, set it to trap the Ring so that he may simply bring it
 out after it is thrown in…” A memory of awful clarity came over Frodo then,
 and a flash of black laughter, and the thought came to him that it was
 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 what the Enemy would do.
 Only the thought came to him so: 
\emph on
thus it would amuse me to do, if I meant to rule…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were doubtful glances exchanged within the council; Glóin and Gimli
 and Boromir were now looking at the Elves more skeptically than before,
 like they had awoken out of a dream of words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The Enemy is very wise,” said Gandalf, “and weighs all things to a nicety
 in the scales of his malice.
 But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so
 he judges all hearts.
 Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that
 having the Ring we may seek to destroy it

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“He 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 think of it!” cried Frodo.
 He struggled for words, trying to convey things that had once seemed perfect
 in his comprehension, and then faded like melting snow.
 “If the Enemy thought that all his foes were moved by desire for power
 alone 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 he would guess wrongly, over and over, and the Maker of this Ring would
 
\emph on
see
\emph default
 that, he would 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 that somewhere he had made a mistake!” Frodo's hands stretched forth pleadingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Boromir stirred, and his voice was doubtful.
 “You speak fair of the Enemy,” said Boromir, “for one of his foes.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo's mouth opened and shut in desperate bewilderment; for Frodo knew,
 he knew the Man was mad, but he could think of nothing to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Bilbo spoke, and his withered voice silenced the whole room, even Elrond
 who had been about to speak.
 “Frodo is right, I fear,” whispered the old hobbit.
 “I remember, I remember what it was like.
 To see with the Black Sight.
 I remember.
 The Enemy will think that we might not trust one another, that the weaker
 among us will propose to destroy the Ring so that the stronger may not
 have it.
 He knows that even one not truly good might still cry to destroy the Ring,
 to make a show of pretended goodness.
 And the Enemy will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 think it impossible that such a decision be made by this council, for you
 see, he does not trust us to be wise.” A whispering chuckle rose from the
 ancient hobbit's throat.
 “And if he did 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

--
\end_layout

\end_inset

 why, he would 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 guard the Cracks of Doom.
 It would cost him little.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now foreboding was on the faces even of the Elves, and the Wise; Elrond
 had frowned, and the sharp eyebrows of Gandalf furrowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo gazed at them all, feeling a wildness come over him, a despair; and
 as his heart weakened a shadow came over his vision, a darkness and a wavering.
 From within the shadow Frodo saw Gandalf, and the wizard's strength was
 revealed as weakness, and his wisdom folly.
 For Frodo knew, as the Ring seemed to drag and weigh on his breast, that
 Gandalf had not thought at all of history and lore, when the wizard spoke
 of how the Enemy would not understand any desire save power; that Gandalf
 had not remembered how Sauron had cast down and corrupted the Men of Númenor
 in the days of their glory.
 Just as it had not occurred to Gandalf that the Enemy might learn to comprehend
 foes of goodwill by 
\emph on
looking…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo's gaze swung to Elrond, but there was no hope there, no answer and
 no rescue in the shadowy vision; for Elrond had let Isildur go, carrying
 the Ring from the Cracks of Doom where it should have been destroyed, to
 the cost of all this war.
 Not for Isildur's own sake, not for friendship had it been done, for the
 Ring had killed Isildur in the end, and far worse fates could have followed
 him.
 But the Doom that had stemmed from Isildur's deed would have seemed unsure
 to Elrond then, unsure and distant in time; and yet the cost to Elrond
 himself of taking his sword's pommel to the back of Isildur's head would
 have been surer, and nearer…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As though in desperation, Frodo turned to look at Aragorn, the weathered
 man who had donned his travel-worn clothes for this council, the heir of
 kings who spoke softly to hobbits.
 But Frodo's vision seemed to double, and in the shadowy second image Frodo
 saw a Man who had spent too much of his youth among Elves, who had learned
 to wear humble and stained clothes amid the gold and jewels, knowing he
 could not match them wisdom for wisdom, and hoping to outplay them in a
 fashion they would not emulate…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sight of the Ring, which was the sight of the Ring's own Maker, all
 noble things faded into stratagems and lies, a world of grey and darkness
 without any light.
 They had not made their choices knowingly, Gandalf or Elrond or Aragorn;
 the impulses had come from the dark hidden parts of themselves, the black
 secret depths which the Ring had rendered plain in Frodo's vision.
 Would they outthink the Shadow, when they could not comprehend even their
 own selves, or the forces that moved them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Frodo!” came the sharp whisper of Bilbo's voice, and Frodo came to himself,
 and halted his hand reaching up toward where the Ring lay on his breast,
 on its chain, dragging like a vast stone around his neck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reaching up to grasp the Ring wherein all answers lay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“How did you bear this thing?” Frodo whispered to Bilbo, as if the two of
 them were the only souls in the room, though all the Council watched them.
 “For years? I cannot imagine it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I kept it locked in a room to which only Gandalf had the key,” said his
 uncle, “and when I began to imagine ways to open it, I remembered Gollum.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A shudder went through Frodo, remembering the tales.
 The horror of the Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking in the dark;
 ruling the goblins from the shadows and filling the tunnels with traps;
 but for Bilbo wearing the ring that first time not a single dwarf would
 have lived.
 And now, Legolas the Elf had told them, Gollum had given up on sending
 his agents against the Shire, had at last found the courage to leave his
 mountains and seek the Ring himself.
 That was Gollum, the fate which Frodo would share himself, if the Ring
 were not destroyed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only they had no way to destroy the Ring.

 had 
\emph on

 maneuvered the Council into sending the Ring straight into Mordor with
 only a tiny guard set on it, as they would have done if Frodo and Bilbo
 had not been there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And having foregone that swiftest of all possible defeats, the only question
 remaining was how long it would take to lose.
 Gandalf had delayed too long, delayed far too long to set this march in
 motion.
 It could have been so easy, if only Bilbo had set out eighty years earlier,
 if only Bilbo had been told what Gandalf had already suspected, if only
 Gandalf's heart had not silently flinched away from the prospect of being
 embarrassingly wrong…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo's hand spasmed on his breast; without thought, his fingers began to
 rise again toward the vast weight of the chain on which the Ring hung.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All he had to do was put on the Ring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just that, and all would become clear to him, once more the slowness and
 mud would leave his thoughts, all possibilities and futures transparent
 to him, he would see through the Shadow's plans and devise an irresistible
 counterstroke

 and he would never be able to take off the Ring, not again, not by any
 will that would be left to him.
 All Frodo had of those moments were fading memories, but he knew that it
 had felt like dying, to let all his towers of thought collapse and become
 only Frodo once more.
 It had felt like dying, he remembered that much of Weathertop even if he
 remembered little else.
 And if he did wear the Ring again, it would be better to die with it on
 his finger, to end his life while he was still himself; for Frodo knew
 that he could not withstand the effects of wearing the Ring a second time,
 not afterward when the limitless clarity was lost to him…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frodo looked around the Council, at the poor lost leaderless Wise, and he
 knew they could not defeat the Shadow by their own strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I will wear it one last time,” Frodo said, his voice broken and failing,
 as he had known from the beginning that he would say in the end, “one last
 time to find the answer for this Council, and then there will be other
 hobbits.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“

” screamed the voice of Sam, as the other hobbit began to rush forward from
 where he had hidden; even as Frodo, with movement as swift and precise
 as a Nazgûl, took out the Ring from beneath his shirt; and somehow Bilbo
 was already standing there and had already thrust his finger through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It all happened before even Gandalf's staff could point, before Aragorn
 could level the hilt-shard of his sword; the Dwarves shouted in shock,
 and the Elves were dismayed.

With a critical eye, Peter looked over the encamped Centaurs with their
 bows, Beavers with their long daggers, and talking Bears with their chain-mail
 draped over them.
 He was in charge, because he was one of the mythical Sons of Adam and had
 declared himself High King of Narnia; but the truth was he didn't really
 know much about encampments, weapons, and guard patrols.
 In the end all he could see was that they all looked proud and confident,

 letting people think that he put us in charge?”

Susan shook her head, shaking the magical arrows in the quiver on her back.
 “If there was really someone like that,” Susan said, “he wouldn't have
 let the White Witch cover the land in winter for a hundred years, would
 he?”

“I had the strangest dream,” Lucy said, her voice even quieter, “where we
 didn't have to organize any creatures or convince them to fight, we just
 walked into this place and the lion was already here, with all the armies
 already mustered, and he went and rescued Edmund, and then we rode alongside
 him into this tremendous battle where he killed the White Witch…”

Alice was sitting by her sister on the bank, reading a book.
 She had several friends who were older, and if she just asked nicely, they

\begin_layout Standard
Hot days often made her feel sleepy and stupid, so Alice had thoughtfully
 wet a handkerchief and placed it at the back of her neck.
 Still her mind had gone off wandering (just as if it was some little kitten
 whose owner had taken off her eyes for just a moment), and she had just
 decided that the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth around
 4/3 of the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, which was nonetheless
 not equal to the opportunity cost of putting down her book, when suddenly
 a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

 or a watch to take out of it.

Oh bother,

 she said to herself (though not aloud; she had long since cured herself
 of that habit, as it made people take her even less seriously than they
 already did).

If I did not immediately recognize how much curiouser that was than the
