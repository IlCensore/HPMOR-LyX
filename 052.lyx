 adrenaline was already flowing in Harry's veins, his heart already hammering
 in his chest, there in that darkened and bankrupt store.
 Professor Quirrell had finished explaining, and in one hand, Harry held
 a tiny wooden twig that would be the key.
 This was it, this was the day and the moment when Harry started acting
 the part.
 His first true adventure, a dungeon to be pierced, an evil government to
 be defied, a maiden in distress to be rescued.
 Harry should have been more frightened, more reluctant, but instead he
 felt only that it was time and past time to start becoming the people he
 had read about in his books; to begin his journey toward what he had always
 known he was meant to be, a hero.
 To take the first step on the road that led to Kimball Kinnison and Captain
 Picard and Liono of Thundera and definitely 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 Raistlin Majere.
 So far as Harry's brain knew from watching early morning cartoons, when
 you grew up you were supposed to gain amazing powers and save the universe,
 that was what Harry's brain had seen adults doing and adopted as its role
 model for the maturation process, and Harry very much wanted to start growing
 up.

And if the pattern of the story called for the hero to lose some part of
 his innocence, as the result of his first adventure; then for now, at least,
 in this still-innocent moment, it seemed time and past time for him to
 experience that pain.
 Like casting off clothes too small for him; or like finally advancing to
 the next stage of the game, after being stuck for eleven years on world
 3, level 2 of Super Mario Brothers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had read enough novels to suspect that he wouldn't feel this enthusiastic
 afterward, so he was enjoying it while it lasted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a popping sound as something near Harry disappeared, and then
 there was no more time for heroic brooding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's hand snapped the small wooden twig.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hook yanked motionlessly at Harry's abdomen as the portkey activated,
 feeling like a much harder pull this time than the smaller transports between
 the Hogwarts grounds and Diagon Alley

 and dropped him into the middle of a huge roll of thunder dying away, and
 a lash of cold rain whipping him across the face, the water coating Harry's
 glasses and blinding him in an instant, turning the world into a blur even
 as he began to fall toward the raging ocean waves far below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had arrived high, high, high above the empty North Sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shock of the blasting storm almost made Harry let go of the broomstick
 that Professor Quirrell had given him, which would not have been a good
 idea.
 It took nearly a full second for Harry to get his wits together and bring
 his broomstick back up in an easy swoop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm here,” said an unfamiliar voice from a patch of empty air above him;
 low and gravelly, the voice of the sallow lanky bearded man Professor Quirrell
 had Polyjuiced into before Disillusioning himself and his broomstick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm here,” Harry said from beneath the Cloak of Invisibility.
 He hadn't used Polyjuice himself.
 Wearing a different body hindered your magic, and Harry might need all
 of his little magic about him; thus the plan called for Harry to stay invisible
 at nearly all times, instead of Polyjuicing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Neither of them had spoken the other's name.
 You simply didn't use your names at any point during an illegal mission,
 even invisibly hovering over an anonymous patch of water in the North Sea.
 You simply didn't.
 It would be stupid.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carefully keeping a grip on the broomstick with one hand, while the rain
 and wind howled around him, Harry raised his wand in an equally careful
 grip and Imperviused his glasses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, with the lenses clear, Harry looked around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was surrounded by wind and rain, it might have been five degrees Celsius
 if he was lucky; he'd already had a Warming Charm cast on himself just
 from being outside in February, but it wasn't standing up to the driving
 cold droplets.
 Worse than snow, the rain soaked into every exposed surface.
 The Cloak of Invisibility turned all of you invisible, but it didn't 
\emph on
cover
\emph default
 all of you, and that meant it didn't protect all of you from rain.
 Harry's face was exposed to the full force of the driven water, and it
 was driving straight into his neck and soaking down into his shirt, also
 the sleeves of his robes and the cuffs of his pants and his shoes, the
 water took every bit of cloth as an avenue to sneak in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This way,” said the Polyjuiced voice, and a spark of green light lit up
 in front of Harry's broomstick, and then darted away in a direction that
 seemed to Harry like every other direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through the blinding rain, Harry followed.
 He lost it sometimes, that small green spark, and each time he did, Harry
 called out, and the spark would reappear in front of him a few seconds
 later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Harry had caught the trick of following the spark, it accelerated,
 and Harry kicked the broomstick into high gear and followed.
 The rain whipped him harder, feeling like Harry imagined it must feel to
 get a faceful of shotgun pellets, but his glasses stayed clear and protected
 his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was only a few minutes later, at the broomstick's full speed, that Harry
 caught a glimpse of a huge shadow through the rain, towering far across
 the waters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And felt a distant, hollow echo of emptiness radiating from where Death
 waited, washing over Harry's mind and parting around it, like a wave breaking
 on stone.
 Harry knew his enemy this time, and his will was steel and all of the light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can already feel the Dementors,” said the gravelly voice of the Polyjuiced
 Quirrell.
 “I did not expect that, not this soon.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Think of the stars,” Harry said, over a distant rumble of thunder.
 “Don't allow any anger in you, nothing negative, just think of the stars,
 what it feels like to forget yourself and fall bodilessly through space.
 Hold to that thought like an Occlumency barrier across your entire mind.
 The Dementors will have some trouble reaching past that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was silence for a moment, then, “Interesting.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The green spark lifted, and Harry inclined his broomstick slightly upward
 to follow, even as it steered them into a fogbank, a cloud hovering low
 on the waters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soon they were hovering above and slightly oblique of the huge three-sided
 metal building, as it loomed far below.
 The triangle of steel was hollow, not solid, it was a building of three
 thick solid walls and no center.
 The Aurors on guard roomed in the top level and southern side of the building,
 Professor Quirrell had said, protected by their Patronus Charms.
 The legal entrance into Azkaban was on the roof of the southwest corner
 of the building.
 Which the two of them wouldn't use, of course.
 Instead they would use a corridor that ran directly beneath the northern
 corner of the building.
 Professor Quirrell would go down first, and puncture a hole in the roof
 and its wards right at the northern tip, leaving behind an illusion to
 cover the gap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prisoners were kept in the side of the building, in levels corresponding
 to their crimes.
 And at the bottom, in the uttermost center and depth of Azkaban, lay a
 nest of more than a hundred Dementors.
 Loads of dirt were occasionally dropped in to keep up the level, as the
 matter directly exposed to the Dementors broke down into mud and nothingness…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Wait one minute,” said the rough voice, “follow me at speed, and pass through
 with care.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Got it,” Harry said lowly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spark winked out, and Harry began to count, 
\emph on
one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
…sixty one thousand,
\emph default
 and Harry dived, the wind shrieking around him as he dived, down toward
 the vast metal structure, down toward where he could feel the shadows of
 Death waiting for him, draining light and radiating emptiness, as the metal
 structure grew larger and larger.
 Plain and featureless loomed the vast grey shape, but for a single raised
 boxlike structure in the southwest corner.
 The north corner was simply blank, Professor Quirrell's hole undetectable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry pulled up sharply as he approached the north corner, giving himself
 more safety margin than he would have bothered with in flying classes,
 but not too much.
 As soon as he'd come to a halt, he began to slowly lower his broomstick
 again, toward what looked like the solid roof of the tip of the north corner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Descending through the illusory roof while invisible was a strange experience,
 and then Harry found himself in a metal corridor lighted with a dim orange
 light 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 which, Harry realized after a startled glance, was coming from an old-fashioned
 mantled gas lamp…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…for magic would fail, be drained away after a time, in the presence of
 Dementors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry dismounted his broom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pull of the emptiness was stronger now, as it parted and flowed around
 Harry without touching him.
 They were distant but they were many, the wounds in the world; Harry could
 have pointed to them with his eyes closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Casst your Patronuss,
\emph default
” hissed a snake from the floor, looking more discolored than green in the
 dim orange light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The note of stress came through even in Parseltongue.
 Harry was surprised; Professor Quirrell had said that Animagi in their
 Animagus forms were much less vulnerable to Dementors.
 (For the same reason the Pa\SpecialChar \-
tronuses were animals, Harry assumed.) If Professor
 Quirrell was in this much trouble in his snake form, what had been happening
 to him while he was in the human form that let him use his magic…?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's wand was already rising in his hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be the beginning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if it was only one person, just one person that he could save from
 the darkness, even if he wasn't powerful enough yet to teleport 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of Azkaban's prisoners to safety and burn the triangular hell down to bedrock…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even so it was a start, it was a beginning, it was a down payment on everything
 that Harry meant to accomplish with his life.
 No more waiting, no more hoping, no more mere promising, it would all begin
 here.
 Here and 
\emph on
now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's wand slashed down to point at where the Dementors waited far below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Expecto Patronum!
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The glowing humanoid figure blazed up into existence.
 It wasn't the sun-bright thing that it had been before… probably because
 Harry hadn't quite been able to stop himself from thinking about all the
 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 prisoners in their cells, the ones that he 
\emph on
wasn't
\emph default
 here to save.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be for the best, though.
 Harry would need to keep this Patronus going for a while, and it might
 be better if it wasn't quite so bright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Patronus dimmed a little further, at that thought; and then further
 again, as Harry tried to put a little less of his strength into it, until
 finally the brilliant humanoid figure was glowing only slightly brighter
 than the brightest animal Patronus, and Harry felt that he could dim it
 no further without risking losing it entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, “
\emph on
It iss sstable,
\emph default
” Harry hissed, and began feeding his broomstick into his pouch.
 His wand stayed in his hand, and a slight, sustainable flow from him replaced
 the slight losses from his Patronus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake blurred into the form of a lanky, sallow man, holding Professor
 Quirrell's wand in one hand and a broomstick in the other.
 The lanky man staggered as he came back into existence, and went to lean
 against the wall for a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well done, if perhaps a trifle slow,” murmured the gravelly voice.
 Professor Quirrell's dryness was in it, even though it didn't fit the voice,
 nor did the grave look on the thickly bearded face.
 “I cannot feel them at all, now.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later, the broomstick went into the man's robes and vanished.
 Then the man's wand rose and tapped on his head, and with a sound like
 a cracking eggshell he disappeared once more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the air blossomed a faint green spark, and Harry, still enshrouded
 in the Cloak of Invisibility, followed after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you had been watching from outside, you would have seen nothing but a
 small green spark drifting through the air, and a brilliantly silver humanoid
 walking after it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went down, and down, and down, passing gas lamp after gas lamp, and
 the occasional huge metal door, descending into Azkaban within what seemed
 like utter silence.
 Professor Quirrell had set up some type of barrier by which 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 could hear what went on nearby, but no sounds could pass outward, and no
 sounds could reach Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry hadn't quite been able to stop his mind from wondering 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 the silence, or stop his mind from giving the answer.
 The answer he'd already known on some wordless level of anticipation that
 had prompted him to futilely try not to think about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhere behind those huge metal doors, people were screaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening and dimming, every time
 Harry thought about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had been told to cast a Bubble-Head Charm on himself.
 To prevent himself from smelling anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the enthusiasm and heroism had worn off already, as Harry had known
 it would, it hadn't taken long even by his standards, the process had completed
 itself the very first time they passed one of those metal doors.
 Every metal door was locked with a huge lock, a lock of simple unmagical
 metal that wouldn't have stopped a first-year Hogwarts student 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 if you still had a wand, if you still had your magic, which the prisoners
 didn't.
 Those metal doors were not the doors of individual cells, Professor Quirrell
 had said, each one opened into a corridor in which there would be a group
 of cells.
 Somehow that helped a little, not thinking that each door corresponded
 directly to a prisoner who was waiting right behind it.
 Instead there might be 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 than one prisoner, which diminished the emotional impact; just like the
 study showing that people contributed more when they were told that a given
 amount of money was required to save one child's life, than when told the
 same total amount was needed to save eight children…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was finding it increasingly hard not to think about it, and every
 time he did, the light of his Patronus fluctuated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They came to the place where the passageway turned left, at the corner of
 the triangular building.
 Once again there were descending metal steps, another flight of stairs;
 once again they went down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mere murderers were not put into the lowest of cells.
 There was always a lower place you could go, an even worse punishment to
 fear.
 No matter how low you had already sunk, the government of magical Britain
 had some threat remaining against you if you did even worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Bellatrix Black had been the Death Eater who inspired more fear than
 anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, a beautiful and deadly sorceress absolutely
 loyal to her master; she had been, if such a thing were possible, more
 sadistic and evil even than You-Know-Who, as though she were trying to
 outdo her master…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…that was what the world knew of her, what the world believed of her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But before then, Professor Quirrell had told Harry, before the debut of
 the Dark Lord's most terrible servant, there had been a girl in Slytherin
 who had been quiet, keeping mostly to herself, harming no one.
 Afterward there had been made-up stories told about her, memories changing
 in retrospect (Harry knew well the research on that).
 But at the time, while she still attended school, the most talented witch
 in Hogwarts had been known as a gentle girl (Professor Quirrell had said).
 Her few friends had been surprised when she'd joined the Death Eaters,
 and more surprised that she'd been hiding so much darkness behind that
 sad, wistful smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was who Bellatrix had once been, the most promising witch of her own
 generation, before the Dark Lord stole her and broke her, shattered her
 and reshaped her, binding her to him on a deeper level and with darker
 arts than any Imperius.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ten years Bellatrix had served the Dark Lord, killing who he bade her kill,
 torturing who he bade her torture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then the Dark Lord had finally been defeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Bellatrix's nightmare had continued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhere inside Bellatrix there might be something that was still screaming,
 that had been screaming the whole time, something a psychiatric Healer
 could bring back; or there might not be, Professor Quirrell had no way
 of knowing.
 But either way, they could…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…they could at least get her out of Azkaban…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bellatrix Black had been put into the lowest level of Azkaban.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was having trouble not imagining what he would see when they got to
 her cell.
 Bellatrix must have had almost no fear of death, in the beginning, if she
 was still alive at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They descended another flight of stairs, coming that much closer to Death
 and Bellatrix, the clacking of their invisible shoes the only sound that
 Harry could hear.
 Dim orange light coming from the gas lights, the faint green spark drifting
 through the air, the shining figure following with its silver light fluctuating
 from time to time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After descending many times, they came in time to a corridor that did not
 end in stairs, and a final metal door, and the green spark halted before
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's heart had calmed a little, as they descended far into the depths
 of Azkaban without anything happening.
 But now it was hammering his chest once more.
 They were at the bottom, and the shadows of Death were very close at hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A soft metal click came from the lock, as Professor Quirrell opened the
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took a deep breath and remembered everything that Professor Quirrell
 had told him.
 The hard part wouldn't just be getting the pretended personality right
 enough to fool Bellatrix Black herself, the hard part would be keeping
 his Patronus going at the same time…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The green spark winked out, and a moment later a meter-high snake shimmered
 into existence, no longer invisible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metal door moved with a slow creaking sound as Harry pushed on it with
 his invisible hand, opened it just a crack, and peered through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He saw a straight corridor that terminated in solid stone.
 There was no light there but what crept in from Harry's Patronus.
 That was bright enough for him to see the outer bars of the eight cells
 set into the corridor, but he couldn't see the insides; more importantly,
 though, he didn't see anyone in the corridor itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
I ssee nothing,
\emph default
” hissed Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The snake darted on ahead, swiftly twisting across the floor.

 Harry thought to his Patronus, which took up a position just to one side
 of the door, as though guarding it; and then Harry pushed the door open
 further, and followed within.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first cell Harry looked at contained a dessicated corpse, skin gone
 grey and mottled, flesh worn through in places to expose the bone beneath,
 no eyes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shut his eyes.
 He could still do that, he was still invisible, he wasn't betraying anything
 by shutting his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd known it already, he'd read it on page six of his Transfiguration book,
 that you stayed in Azkaban until your prison term was done.
 If you died before it was up they kept you there until they released your
 corpse.
 If your term was for life, they just left the body in the cell until the
 cell was needed, at which point they threw your body into the Dementors'
 pit.
 But it was still a shock to see, that corpse had been a

Steady,

 thought Harry in his core.
 It wouldn't be good for Professor Quirrell if that Patronus went out from
 his thinking sad thoughts.
 This near to the Dementors the Defense Professor might just fall dead where
 he stood.
 
\emph on
Steady, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, steady!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that thought, Harry opened his eyes again, there wasn't time to waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second cell he looked at contained only a skeleton.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And behind the bars of the third cell he saw Bellatrix Black.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Something precious and irreplaceable inside Harry withered like dry grass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You could tell the woman wasn't a skeleton, that her head wasn't a skull,
 because the texture of skin was still different from the texture of bone,
 no matter how white and pale she'd become, waiting in the dark alone.
 Either they weren't feeding her much, or what she ate, the shadows of Death
 drained from her; for her eyes seemed shrunken below their lids, her lips
 looked too shriveled to close over her teeth.
 The color seemed leached out of the black clothing she had worn into prison,
 like the Dementors had drained that too.
 They'd been meant to be daring, those clothes, and now they lay loosely
 over a skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I'm here to save her, I'm here to save her, I'm here to save her,

 Harry thought to himself, desperately, over and over with an effort like

In his heart, in his core, Harry held to all his pity and his compassion,

\begin_layout Standard
And in another part of him, like he was just letting another part of his
