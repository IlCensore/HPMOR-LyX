 though today the cushioned benches did not look upon flying broomsticks,
 but rather viewed a gigantic square of something like parchment; a great
 white blankness soon to flicker with windows into grass and soldiers.

Davis had insisted on an audience with Deputy Headmistress McGonagall.

Davis had argued their way into the Faculty Box of the Hogwarts Quidditch
 stands, where they were now ensconced with an excellent view of Professor
 Quirrell's enchanted screens, so that the two of them could see for themselves
 “Just what the Fiddly-Snocks has been going on in this school, if you'll

Davis, one would find the comely Lady and yet handsomer Lord of the Noble
 and Most Ancient House of Greengrass.
 Young they were as wizards counted age, garbed in grey silken robes set
 with tiny dark emeralds embroidered into the shape of grass blades.
 The Lady Greengrass was considered a key swing vote on the Wizengamot,
 her own mother having retired from the body with surprising speed.
 Her charming husband, though his family was not noble or wealthy of itself,
 had taken a seat on the Hogwarts Board of Governors.
\end_layout

Davis without the slightest hint of condescension.
 This was Amelia Bones, Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Amelia's right was a seniorish woman who had set the fashion scene of
 magical Britain on its ear by integrating a live vulture into her hat,
 one Augusta Longbottom.
 Though she was not addressed as Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise the
 full rights of the Longbottom family for so long as their last scion had
 yet to attain his majority, and she was considered a prominent figure in
 a minority faction of the Wizengamot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the side of Madam Longbottom was seated none other than Chief Warlock
 Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, legendary
 defeater of Grindelwald, protector of Britain, rediscoverer of the fabled
 twelve uses of dragon's blood, the most powerful wizard in the world &c.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And finally, on the far right, one would find the enigmatic Defense Professor
 of Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, who was leaning back on the cushioned benches
 as though resting; seeming entirely and naturally at ease in the rarefied
 company of a voting quorum of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, which had
 dropped by on this fine Saturday to learn just what the Fiddly-Snocks had
 been going on at Hogwarts in general and with Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott,
 Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Neville Longbottom in particular.
 The name of Harry Potter had also been much discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh, and one mustn't forget Tracey Davis, of course.
 Director Bones's eyebrows had climbed in some interest upon hearing the
 young couple introduced as her parents.
 Lord Jugson had given them a brief, incredulous stare before dismissing
 them with a snort.
 Lucius Malfoy had greeted them politely, his smile containing a hint of
 grim amusement mixed with pity.

Davis, whose last vote on anything of significance had been touching their
 wands to the name of Minister Fudge, who had all of three hundred Galleons
 stored in their Gringotts vault, and who respectively worked at selling
 cauldrons in a Potions shop and enchanting Omnioculars, were pressed up
 tightly against each other, sitting rigidly erect upon their cushioned
 benches, and desperately wishing they'd worn nicer robes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sky above was a solid mass of cloud dispersed into darker and lighter
 grays, grim with the promise of future storms; though no lightning flickered
 as yet, nor distant rumbles of thunder echoed; and only a few threatening
 droplets had fallen.

To their designated starting place in a certain forest, the Sunshine Regiment
 marched, though it was really more like a slow walk; you wouldn't want
 to tire yourself out before the battle even started, and the breezes of
 April were annoyingly humid, though cool.
 Ahead of them, a yellow flame wandered slowly through the air, guiding
 them according to their pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward the Sunshine General as
 they marched through the grayly illuminated forest.
 Professor Snape's going after Hermione seemed to have really shaken her.
 Hermione had even missed her Sunshine Regiment Official Planning Meeting,
 which seemed understandable enough; but when Susan had offered her sympathy
 afterward, Hermione had stammered that she'd lost track of time, which
 wasn't at all a usual thing for her to say, and the girl had looked exhausted
 and frightened like she'd just spent three days locked in a bathroom stall
 with a Dementor.
 Even now, when all the Sunshine General's focus should've been on the coming
 battle, the Ravenclaw girl's gaze was constantly darting in all directions,
 as though she expected Dark Wizards to jump out of the bushes and sacrifice
 her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The ban on Muggle artifacts cuts down our options a lot,” Anthony Goldstein
 was saying in the dour tones the boy used to denote deliberate pessimism.
 “I had the idea of trying to Transfigure nets to throw on people, but

\end_inset

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No good,” said Ernie Macmillan.
 The Hufflepuff boy shook his head, looking even more serious than Anthony.
 “I mean, it's just like throwing a hex, they'd 
\emph on
dodge
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anthony nodded.
 “That's what I figured, too.
 Do you have any ideas, Seamus?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked a bit nervous and out-of-place,
 marching along with his new comrades in the Sunshine Regiment.
 “Sorry,” said the newly minted Captain Finnigan.
 “I'm more the strategic master type.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
I'm
\emph default
 the strategic master type,” said Ron Weasley, sounding put-off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There are 
\emph on
three
\emph default
 armies,” the Sunshine General said acerbically, “which means we fight 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 armies at once, which means we need more than one strategist, which means
 shut up, Ron!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ron gave their General a surprised and worried look.
 “Hey,” the Gryffindor boy said in a calming tone, “you shouldn't let Snape
 get to you so much

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What do 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 think we ought to do, General?” Susan said very loudly and quickly.
 “I mean, we don't really have a plan at this point.” Their official planning
 session had failed
\emph on
 amazingly
\emph default
 with Hermione gone and both Ron and Anthony thinking they were in charge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do we really need a plan?” the Sunshine General said, sounding a little
 distracted.
 “We've got you and me and Lavender and Parvati and Hannah and Daphne and
 Ron and Ernie and Anthony 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 Captain Finnigan.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That

” began Anthony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Sounds like a pretty good strategy,” Ron said with an approving nod.
 “We've got as many strong soldiers now as both other armies put together.
 Chaos's only got Potter and Longbottom and Nott left

“And Tracey,” said Hermione.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several people swallowed nervously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh, 
\emph on
stop it,
\emph default
” Susan said sharply.
 “She's just a battle-hardened member of S.P.H.E.W., that's all General Sunshine
 means.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Still,” Ernie said, turning to look seriously at Susan, “I think you'd
 better go with whatever group fights Chaos, Captain Bones.
 I know you can't use your double magical powers except when innocents are
 in danger, but I mean 
\begin_inset ERT

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can handle her,” Susan told him, keeping her voice reassuring.
 Admittedly, Susan hadn't been replaced by a Metamorphmagus at the moment,
 but then Tracey probably wasn't Polyjuiced Dumbledore or whoever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Captain Finnigan intoned in a deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, “I find your
 lack of skepticism disturbing.” He raised his hand with his thumb and forefinger
 almost touching, pointed at Ernie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some reason Anthony Goldstein seemed to be having a sudden choking fit.
 “What's that supposed to mean?” said Ernie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's just something General Potter says sometimes,” said Captain Finnigan.
 “Funny, when you first join the Chaos Legion it all seems crazy, and then
 after a couple of months you realize that actually everyone who 
\emph on
isn't
\emph default
 in the Chaos Legion is crazy

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I 
\emph on
said
\emph default
,” Ron said loudly, “it sounds like good strategy.
 We don't Transfigure anything, we don't tire ourselves out, we handle whatever
 they throw at us, and then we just overrun them.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Okay,” said Hermione.
 “Let's do that.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

” said Anthony, shooting a glare at Ron.
 “But General, Harry Potter's got 
\emph on

 people left in his army.
 Dragon and us each have twenty-eight.
 Harry 
\emph on

\emph default
 that, he knows he's

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Like 
\emph on
what?
\emph default
” demanded Hermione, sounding stressed.
 “If we don't 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 what he's planning, we might as well save our magic for doing massed 
\emph on
Finites.

\emph default
 Like we
\emph on

\emph on
last
\emph default
 time!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Susan touched Hermione gently on the shoulder.
 “General Granger?” said Susan.
 “I think you should take a break for a bit before the battle.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She'd been expecting Hermione to argue, but Hermione just nodded and then
 walked a little faster, pulling away from the Sunshine Regiment Official
 Officer Group, her eyes still watching the forest, and sometimes the sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Susan followed her.
 It wouldn't do, having it look like the Sunshine General was being ejected
 from her own Official Officer Group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hermione?” Susan said softly, after they'd walked a bit away.
 “You've got to focus.
 Professor Quirrell's in charge here, not Snape, and he won't let anything
 bad happen to you or anyone.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You're not helping,” Hermione said, sounding shaky.
 “You're not helping at all, Captain Bones.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them walked faster, circling around some of the other soldiers,
 inspecting the marching perimeter and glancing at the surrounding trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Susan?” Hermione said in a small voice, when they'd gotten further away
 from all the others.
 “Do you think Daphne's right about Draco Malfoy plotting something?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” Susan said at once, not even thinking about it.
 “You can tell, because his name's got the letters M-A-L-F-O and Y in it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione looked around, as if to make sure that nobody was watching, although
 of course that was a wonderful way to get other people to pay attention
 to you.
 “Could Malfoy have been behind what Snape did?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Snape could be behind Malfoy,” Susan said thoughtfully, remembering dinner-tabl
e conversations she'd heard at Auntie's, “or Lucius Malfoy could be behind
 both of them.” A slight chill went down Susan's spine as this last thought
 occurred to her.
 Suddenly, telling Hermione to just focus on the coming battle seemed a
 lot less reasonable.
 “Why, did you find some sort of clue about that?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione shook her head.
 “No,” the Ravenclaw girl said, in a voice that sounded almost like she
 was about to cry.
 “I was

\begin_layout Standard
In their designated place in a forest near Hogwarts, the Dragon General
 and the warriors of Dragon Army waited where their red flame had led them,
 beneath grey skies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At Draco's right side stood Padma Patil, his second-in-command, who had
 once led all of Dragon Army after Draco had been stunned.
 At Draco's back was Vincent, the son of Crabbe, a family which had served
 the Malfoys into the distance of forgotten memory; the muscular boy was
 watchful as he was always watchful, whether battle had been declared or
 no.
 Further back, Gregory of the Goyles stood waiting beside one of the two
 broomsticks Dragon Army had been given; if the Goyles had not served the
 Malfoys so long as the Crabbes, yet they had served no less well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And at Draco's left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas of Gryffindor, a mudblood
 or possible half-blood who knew nothing of his father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sending Dean Thomas to Dragon Army had been a quite deliberate move on Harry's
 part, Draco was certain.
 Three other former Chaotics had also been transferred to Dragon Army, and
 all were watching Draco hawklike to see if he offered the former Lieutenant
 the slightest insult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some might have called it sabotage, but Draco knew better.
 Harry had also sent Lieutenant Finnigan to the Sunshine Regiment, even
 though Professor Quirrell's mandate had only required that Harry give up
 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 Lieutenant.
 That too had been a deliberate move, making crystal clear to everyone that
 Harry 
\emph on
wasn't
\emph default
 dumping his least-favored soldiers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In one sense, it might have been easier for Draco to win the true loyalties
 of his new soldiers if they'd thought Harry hadn't wanted them.
 In another sense… well, it wasn't easy to put into words.
 Harry had given him good soldiers with their pride intact, but it was more
 than that.
 Harry had showed kindliness toward his soldiers, but it was more than 
\emph on
that
\emph default
.
 It wasn't just Harry playing fair, it was something that… that you couldn't
 help but contrast with the way the game was played in Slytherin House.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Draco hadn't offered the slightest insult to Mr.

Thomas, but brought him straight to his side, subordinate to himself and
 Padma but no one else.
 It was a test, Draco had told Mr.

Thomas and everyone, not a promotion.
 Mr.

Thomas had looked surprised at the ceremony of it (the Chaos Legion, from
 what Draco had heard, didn't stand on formality) but the Gryffindor boy
 had stood a little straighter, and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, after Mr.

Thomas had done well enough in one of Dragon Army's training sessions, he'd
 been brought into the strategy session in Dragon Army's huge military office.
 And a few minutes into the session, Padma had happened to ask 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 as though it was a perfectly normal question 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 whether Mr.
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Thomas had any ideas about how to defeat the Chaos Legion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gryffindor boy had said cheerfully that Harry had predicted that General
 Malfoy would get one of his soldiers to ask him that, and that Harry had
 given him the message that General Malfoy should ask himself where his
 relative advantage lay 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 what Draco Malfoy could do, or what Dragon Army could do, that the Chaos
 Legion couldn't match 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and then try to exploit it for all it was worth.
 Dean Thomas couldn't think of what that advantage might be, but if he 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 come up with any ideas for beating Chaos, he'd share them.
 Harry had ordered him to, after all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
 Sigh,
\emph default
 Draco had thought, since he couldn't actually sigh out loud.
 But it was good advice, and Draco had followed it, sitting at his bedroom
 desk with quill and parchment listing out everything that might be a relative
 advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, almost to Draco's own surprise, he'd had an 
\emph on
idea,
\emph default
 a real one.
 In fact he'd had 
\emph on
two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hollow bell sounded through the forest, somehow sounding more ominous

 On the instant, the two pilots cried “

Davis had now slumped slightly against each other, more from sheer muscle
 exhaustion than from any decrease of tension.
 Before them, the vast blank white parchment flickered with three great
 windows, as though holes had been cut through into the forest, showing
 three armies on the march.
 Lesser windows showed the six riders upon their broomsticks, and the corner
 of the parchment showed a view of the entire forest, with glowing dots
 to indicate armies and scouts.

 The Sunshine Regiment, the Defense Professor had remarked, knew well that

The Dragon Warrior raised her gloved hand, flexed it, and gave a small bow

A handful of seconds later, the soldier who'd code-named herself Gingersnap

 Gingersnap approached to where Shannon was holding a uniform-shirt with
 the neck tied off, in lieu of anyone having to Transfigure a bag.
 When Gingersnap brought her hands forward to try and dump her acorns into
 the holding-shirt, Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked the shirt to the right,
 then to the left again as Gingersnap made another effort to dump the acorns,
 until a sharp “Miss Friedman!” from Lieutenant Nott caused Shannon to sigh

 Gingersnap dumped her acorns into those accumulated, and then headed out

Conservation laws.
 They'd been the critical insight in more Muggle discoveries than Harry

 In Muggle technology you couldn't raise a feather one meter off the ground

 If you looked at molten lava spilling from a volcano and asked where the
 heat came from, a physicist would tell you about radioactive heavy metals
 in the center of the Earth's molten core.
 If you asked where the energy to power the radioactivity came from, the
 physicist would point to an era before the Earth had formed, and a primordial
 supernova in the early days of the galaxy which had baked atomic nuclei
 heavier than the natural limit, the supernova compressing protons and neutrons
 into a tight unstable package that yielded back some of the supernova's
 energy when it split.
 A light bulb was fueled by electricity, fueled by a nuclear power plant,

 That was a simple fifth-year spell, not considered impressive by wizards,
 because creating a mere glass of water didn't seem amazing to them.
 They didn't have the wacky notion that mass ought to be conserved, or that
 creating a gram of mass was somehow equivalent to creating 90,000,000,000,000

 Harry had hypothesized

\end_layout

\end_inset

 you were doing something like casting a small spell that reshaped the magic
 in the ingredients.
 (And unbound the physical form so that ingredients like porcupine quills
 dissolved smoothly into a drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected that
 a Muggle following exactly the same recipe would end up with nothing but
 a spiny mess.) That was what Potions-Making really
\emph on
 was,
\emph default
 the art of transforming existing magical essences.
 So you were a 
\emph on
little
\emph default
 tired after Potions class, but not much, because you weren't empowering
 the potions yourself, you were just reshaping magic that was already there.
 And that was why a second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, or at least
 get close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had kept scanning through

 After five minutes he'd flipped the older boy another Sickle, (over his

 and kept going.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
potion of giant strength
\emph default
 required a Re'em to trample the mashed Dugbogs you stirred into the potion.
 It was odd, Harry had realized after a moment, because crushed Dugbogs
 weren't strong themselves, they were just… very, very crushed after the
 Re'em got through with them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another recipe said to `touch with forged bronze', i.e., grasp a Knut in pliers
 so you could skim the potion's surface; and if you dropped the Knut all
 the way in, the book warned, the potion would instantly superheat and boil
 over the cauldron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had stared at the recipes and their warnings, forming a second and
 stranger hypothesis.
 Of course it wouldn't be as simple as Potions-Making using magical potentials
 imbued in the ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled by the combustion potential
 of gasoline.
 Magic would never be as

 as that…

\begin_layout Standard
After Professor Flitwick had stopped screaming in horror and running in

 fierce interrogation to promise Harry that in this case it was both acceptable
 and important for him to reveal his underlying theory, it had developed
 that Harry had 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 made an original magical discovery, but rediscovered a law so ancient that
 nobody knew who had first formulated it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
A potion spends that which is invested in the creation of its ingredients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heat of goblin forges that had cast the bronze Knut, the Re'em's strength
 that had crushed the Dugbogs, the magical fire that had spawned the Ashwinder:
 all these potencies could be recalled, unlocked, and restructured by the
 spell-like process of stirring the ingredients in exact patterns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(From a Muggle standpoint it was just 
\emph on
odd,
\emph default
 a deranged version of thermodynamics invented by someone who thought life
 ought to be 
\emph on
fair
\emph default
.
 From a Muggle standpoint, the heat expended in forging the Knut hadn't
 gone 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 the bronze, the heat had 
\emph on
left
\emph default
 and dissipated into the environment, becoming permanently less available.
 Energy was conserved, could be neither created nor destroyed; 
\emph on
entropy
\emph default
 always increased.
 But wizards didn't think that way: from their perspective, if you'd put
 some amount of work into making a Knut, it stood to reason that you could
 get exactly the same work back out.
 Harry had tried to explain why this sounded a bit 
\emph on
odd
\emph default
 if you'd been raised by Muggles, and Professor McGonagall had asked bemusedly
 why the Muggle perspective was any better than the wizarding one.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental principle of Potions-Making had no name and no standard

\begin_layout Standard
It had been made very clear to Harry that he

wasn't

 going to be sharing this particular discovery with Neville, or Hermione
 either after the next armies' battle.
 Harry had tried to say something about Hermione seeming really off lately
 and this being just the sort of thing that might cheer her up.
 Professor McGonagall had said flatly that he wasn't even to think it, and
 Professor Flitwick had raised his little hands and made a gesture as of
 snapping a wand in half.

 From the great trunk at his bed's foot, the Slytherin drew forth a book

 And with a new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began to write, frequently looking

Since Harry was looking in the direction of the Slytherin table, he didn't

 awkward silence, began to eat her tomato slices, one after another, without

Harry looked away from her and began to eat a slice of pie which, he discovered,

 waving behind him in a ponytail.
 A man thin and pale and unshaven, with a face so blank that it was like
