Harry had run into trouble falling asleep Friday night, which he had anticipated
 might happen, and so he had decided to take the obvious advance precaution
 of buying a sleeping potion; and to prevent it from constituting a visible
 sign that he was nervous, he had decided to buy it off Fred and George
 a couple of months earlier.

Thus Harry was fully rested, and his pouch contained almost everything which
 he owned and might conceivably need.
 Harry had, in fact, run into the volume limitation on the pouch; and keeping
 in mind that he would need to store a large snake, and might need to store
 who-knew-what-else, he had removed some of the bulkier items, like the
 car battery.
 He was up to the point now where he could Transfigure something the size
 of a car battery in four minutes flat, so it wasn't much of a loss.

After the waitress had taken their order and bowed to them and left the
 room, Professor Quirrell had performed only four Charms, and then they'd
 talked about nothing of any vast consequence, just Professor Quirrell's
 complex thesis about how the Dark Lord's curse on the Defense position
 had led to the decline of dueling and how this had changed social customs
 in magical Britain.
 Harry listened and nodded and said intelligent things, while he tried to
 control the pounding of his heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the waitress came in again bearing their food, and this time, a minute
 after the waitress had departed, Professor Quirrell gestured for the door
 to close and lock, and began to speak twenty-nine security Charms, one

Harry dropped his gaze from the snake's flat eyes, and looked back down
 at his sauce-coated noodles, and ate another bite, then another, while
 he thought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor… was an ambiguous figure, to put it mildly; Harry
 thought he had unraveled some of his goals, but others remained mysterious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Professor Quirrell had knocked down two hundred girls to stop the ones
 summoning Harry.
 Professor Quirrell had deduced that the Dementor was draining Harry through
 his wand.
 The Defense Professor had saved Harry's life, twice, in a two-week period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which could mean that the Defense Professor was just saving Harry 
\emph on
for later,
\emph default
 that there were ulterior motives.
 Indeed, it was 
\emph on
certain
\emph default
 that there were ulterior motives.
 Professor Quirrell wasn't doing this on a whim.
 But then Professor Quirrell had also seen Harry taught Occlumency, he had
 taught Harry how to lose… if the Defense Professor wanted to make some
 use of Harry Potter, it was a use that required a strengthened Harry Potter,
 not a weakened one.
 That was what it meant to be used by a friend, that they would want the
 use to make you stronger instead of weaker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if there was sometimes a cold atmosphere about the Defense Professor,
 bitterness in his voice or emptiness in his gaze, then Harry was the only
 one who Professor Quirrell allowed to see it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't quite know how to describe in words the sense of kinship he
 felt with Professor Quirrell, except to say that the Defense Professor
 was the only 
\emph on
clear-thinking
\emph default
 person Harry had met in the wizarding world.
 Sooner or later everyone else started playing Quidditch, or not putting
 protective shells on their time machines, or thinking that Death was their
 friend.
 It didn't matter how good their intentions were.
 Sooner or later, and usually sooner, they demonstrated that something deep
 inside their brain was confused.
 Everyone except Professor Quirrell.
 It was a bond that went beyond anything of debts owed, or even anything
 of personal liking, that the two of them were alone in the wizarding world.
 And if the Defense Professor occasionally seemed a little scary or a little
 Dark, well, that was just the same thing some people said about Harry.

“

Harry took a final forkful of noodles, chewed.
 Beside him, Professor Quirrell, now in human form again, was eating his
 soup placidly, as though nothing of special interest were occurring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry swallowed, and in the same moment stood up from his chair, already
 feeling his heart start to hammer hard in his chest.
 The security precautions they were taking were literally the most stringent
 possible…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It 
\emph on
wasn't
\emph default
 a test, but Professor Quirrell wouldn't say that, not out loud in human
 speech, even in this room screened to the limit that Professor Quirrell
 had secured with further Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yep,” Harry said as casually as he could.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry said “Cloak” to his pouch, drew forth the Cloak of Invisibility, and
 then unstuck the pouch from his belt and threw it toward the other side
 of the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor stood up from his own seat, drew his wand, bent down,
 and touched his wand to the pouch, murmuring a quiet incantation.
 The new enchantments would ensure that Professor Quirrell could enter the
 pouch on his own in snakeform, and leave it on his own, and hear what went
 on outside while he was in the pouch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Professor Quirrell stood up from where he'd bent over by the pouch, and
 put away his wand, his wand happened to point in Harry's direction, and
 there was a brief crawling sensation on Harry's chest near where the Time-Turne
r lay, like something creepy had passed very close by without touching him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step three.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor turned into a snake again, and the sense of doom diminishe
d; the snake crawled to the pouch and into it, the pouch's mouth opening
 to admit the green shape, and as the mouth closed again behind the tail,
 the sense of doom diminished further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step four.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry drew his wand, being careful to stand still as he did it, so that
 the Time-Turner would not move from where Professor Quirrell had anchored
 the hourglass within the shell in its current orientation.
 “
\emph on
Wingardium Leviosa
\emph default
,” murmured Harry, and the pouch began to float toward him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly, slowly, as Professor Quirrell had instructed, the pouch began to
 float toward Harry, who waited alert for any sign the pouch was opening,
 in which case Harry was to use the Hover Charm to propel it away from him
 as fast as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the pouch came within a meter of Harry, the sense of doom returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Harry reattached the pouch to his belt, the sense of doom was stronger
 than it had ever been, but still not overwhelming; it was tolerable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even with Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within the extended space
 of the pouch resting on Harry's very hip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step five.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry sheathed his wand.
 His other hand still held the Cloak of Invisibility, and Harry drew that
 cloak over himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step six.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so in that room shielded from every possible scrying, which Professor
 Quirrell had personally and further secured, it was not until 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 Harry was wearing the true Cloak of Invisibility that he reached beneath
 his shirt and twisted the outer shell of the Time-Turner just once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored and motionless, the setting
 twisted around it

 door sprang open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mary's Room was deserted, as it should have been, because Professor Quirrell
 had earlier contacted Mary's Place under a false name to inquire whether
 the room would be available at this hour

 but only to inquire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step seven.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Staying under the Cloak of Invisibility, Harry left through the open door.
 He navigated the tiled hallways of Mary's Place to the well-stocked bar
 that greeted new entrants, tended by the owner, Jake.
 There were only a few people at the bar, in the morning before proper lunchtime
, and Harry had to wait invisibly by the door for several minutes, listening
 to the murmur of conversation and the gurgle of alcohol, before the door
 opened to admit a huge genial Irishman, and Harry slipped out silently
 in his wake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step eight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry walked for a while.
 He was well away from Mary's Place when he turned off Diagon Alley into
 a smaller alley, at the end of which lay a shop that was dark, the windows
 enchanted to blackness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step nine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Sword fish melon friend,” Harry spoke the passphrase to the lock, and it
 clicked open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the shop was also darkness, the light from the open door briefly
 illuminating it to show a wide, empty room.
 The furniture shop which had once operated here had gone bankrupt a few
 months ago, according to the Defense Professor, and the shop had been repossess
ed, but not yet resold.
 The walls were painted a simple white, the wooden floor scratched and unpolishe
d, a single closed door set in the back wall; this had been a showroom,
 once, but now it showed nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door clicked shut behind Harry, and then the darkness was pitch and
 complete.

 sense of doom growing a little sharper as he grasped it with his fingers)

From the pouch poked a green head, followed shortly by a meter-long green
 body as the snake slithered out.
 A moment later, the snake blurred into Professor Quirrell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Step twelve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry waited in silence while the Defense Professor recited thirty Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” Professor Quirrell said calmly, when he had finished.
 “If anyone is still watching us now, we are in any case doomed, so I will
 speak plainly and in human form.
 Parseltongue does not quite suit me, I fear, as I am neither a descendant
 of Salazar nor a true snake.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.

\begin_layout Standard
“So, Mr.

Potter,” said Professor Quirrell.
 His gaze intent, his pale blue eyes dark and shadowed in the white light
 coming from Harry's wand.
 “We are alone and unobserved, and I have an important question to ask you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Go ahead,” said Harry, his heart starting to beat faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What is your opinion of the government of magical Britain?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That wasn't quite what Harry had been expecting, but it was close enough,
 so Harry said, “Based on my limited knowledge, I would say that both the
 Ministry and the Wizengamot appear to be stupid, corrupt, and evil.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Correct,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “Do you understand why I ask?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took a deep breath, and looked Professor Quirrell straight in the
 eyes, unflinching.
 Harry had finally worked out that the way to make amazing deductions from
 scanty evidence was to know the answer in advance, and he had guessed this
 answer fully a week ago.
 It needed only a slight adjustment…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You are about to invite me to join a secret organization full of interesting
 people like yourself,” said Harry, “one of whose goals is to reform or
 overthrow the government of magical Britain, and yes, I'm in.”

\begin_layout Standard
There was a slight pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid that is not quite where I intended to direct this conversation,”
 said Professor Quirrell.
 The corners of his lips were twitching slightly.
 “I merely planned to ask for your help in doing something extremely treasonous
 and illegal.”

 thought Harry.
 Still, Professor Quirrell hadn't

“Before I do,” said Professor Quirrell.
 There was no levity in his voice, now.

 “Risks bother me and the stakes would need to be commensurate, but I can't

 “Then I shall skip it.

 You will speak, always and without hesitation, in 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 the fashion you would speak if you knew nothing, with no concern for your
 honor.
 That also is how it must be.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was silence, then, for a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a price measured in a fraction of Harry's soul.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Without telling me yet…” said Harry.
 “Can you say if the need is desperate?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There is someone in the most terrible want of your help,” Professor Quirrell
 said simply, “and there is no one who can help them but you.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was another silence, but not a long one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” Harry said quietly.
 “Tell me of the mission.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark robes of the Defense Professor seemed to blur against the shadow
 on the wall, cast by his silhouette blocking the white light of Harry's
 wand.
 “The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Potter, wards off a Dementor's fear.
 But the Dementors still see you through it, they know that you are there.
 Only not your Patronus Charm.
 It blinds them, or more than blinds them.
 What I saw beneath the cloak wasn't even looking in our direction as you
 killed it; as though it had forgotten our existence, even as it died.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.
 That wasn't surprising, not when you confronted a Dementor on the level
 of its true existence, beyond anthropomorphism.
 Death might be the last enemy, but it wasn't a sentient enemy.
 When humanity had wiped out smallpox, smallpox hadn't fought back.

 low that the goblins know.
 Even so those vaults have been successfully robbed; for what wizardry can
 do, wizardry can undo.
 And yet no one has ever escaped from Azkaban.
 No one.
 For every Charm there is a counter-Charm, for every ward there is a bypass.
 How can it be that no one has ever been rescued from Azkaban?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Because Azkaban has something invincible,” Harry said.
 “Something so terrible that no one can defeat it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was the keystone of their perfect security, it had to be, nothing human.
 It was Death that guarded Azkaban.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The Dementors don't like their meals being taken away from them,” Professor
 Quirrell said.
 Coldness had entered that voice, now.
 “They know if anyone tries.
 There are more than a hundred Dementors there, and they speak to the guards
 as well.
 It's that simple, Mr.

Potter.
 If you're a powerful wizard then Azkaban isn't hard to enter, and it isn't
 hard to leave.
 So long as you don't try to take anything out of it that belongs to the
 Dementors.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But the Dementors are 
\emph on
not

 invincible,” said Harry.
 He could have cast the Patronus Charm with that thought, in that very moment.
 “Never believe that they are.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell's voice was very quiet.
 “Do you remember what it was like when you went before the Dementor, the
 first time, when you failed?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I remember.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then with a sudden sickening lurch in his stomach, Harry knew where
 this was going; he should have seen it before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There is an innocent person in Azkaban,” Professor Quirrell said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded, there was a burning sensation in his throat, but he didn't
 cry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The one of whom I speak was not under the Imperius Curse,” said the Defense
 Professor, dark robes silhouetted against a greater shadow.
 “There are surer ways to break wills than the Imperius, if you have the
 time for torture, and Legilimency, and rituals of which I will not speak.
 I cannot tell you how I know this, how I know any of this, cannot hint
 at it even to you, you will have to trust me.
 But there is a person in Azkaban who never once chose to serve the Dark
 Lord, who has spent years suffering alone in the most terrible cold and
 darkness imaginable, and never deserved a single minute of it.”

Harry saw it in a single leap of intuition, his mouth racing almost ahead
