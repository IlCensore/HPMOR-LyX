 four of them gathered once more around the ancient desk of the Headmaster

 the past paperwork of the Hogwarts School was stored; legend had it that
 Headmistress Shehla had once gotten lost in that desk, and was, in fact,
 still there, and wouldn't be let out again until she got her files organized.
 Minerva didn't particularly look forward to inheriting those drawers, when
 she inherited that desk someday

Albus Dumbledore was seated behind his desk, looking grave and composed.

Severus Snape was standing next to the dead Floo and its ashes, hovering
 ominously like the vampire that students sometimes accused him of pretending

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mad-Eye Moody had been meant to join them, but was yet to arrive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A boy's small, thin frame, perched on the arm of his chair, as though the
 energies running through him were too great to allow ordinary seating.
 Set face, sweaty hair, intent green eyes, and within it all, the jagged
 lightning-bolt of his never-healing scar.
 He seemed grimmer, now; even compared to a single week earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a moment Minerva flashed back to her trip to Diagon Alley with Harry,
 what seemed like ages and ages ago.
 There'd been this somber boy 
\emph on
inside
\emph default
 that Harry, somehow, even then.
 This wasn't entirely her own fault, or Albus's fault.
 And yet there was something almost unbearably sad about the contrast between
 the young boy she'd first met, and what magical Britain had made of him.
 Harry had never had much of an ordinary childhood, she'd gathered; Harry's
 adoptive parents had said to her that he'd spoken little and played less
 with Muggle children.
 It was painful to think that Harry might have had only a few months of
 playing beside the other children in Hogwarts, before the war's demands
 had stripped it all away.
 Maybe there was another face that Harry showed to the children his own
 age, when he wasn't staring down the Wizengamot.
 But she couldn't stop herself from imagining Harry Potter's childhood as
 a heap of firewood, and herself and Albus feeding the wooden branches,
 piece by piece, into the flames.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Prophecies are strange things,” said Albus Dumbledore.
 The old wizard's eyes were half-lidded, as though in weariness.
 “Vague, unclear, meaning escaping like water held between loose fingers.
 Prophecy is ever a burden, for there are no answers there, only questions.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry Potter was sitting tensely.
 “Headmaster Dumbledore,” said the boy with soft precision, “my friends
 are being targeted.
 Hermione Granger almost went to Azkaban.
 The war has begun, as you put it.
 Professor Trelawney's prophecy is key information for weighing up the balance
 of my hypotheses about what's going on.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albus looked a grim question at her, and she shook her head in reply; in
 whatever unimaginable way Harry had discovered that Trelawney had made
 the prophecy and that the Dark Lord knew of it, he hadn't learned that
 much from her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Voldemort, seeking to avert that very prophecy, went to his defeat at your
 hands,” the old wizard said then.
 “His knowledge brought him only harm.
 Ponder that carefully, Harry Potter.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, Headmaster, I do understand that.
 My home culture also has a literary tradition of self-fulfilling and misinterpr
eted prophecies.
 I'll interpret with caution, rest assured.
 But I've already guessed quite a bit.
 Is it safer for me to work from partial guesses?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Minerva,” said Albus.
 “If you would.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The one…” she began.
 The words came falteringly to her throat; she was no actress.
 She couldn't imitate the deep, chilling tone of the original prophecy;
 and yet somehow that tone seemed to carry all the 
\emph on
meaning.

\emph default
 “The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches… born to those
 who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal,
\emph default
” came Severus's voice, making her jump within her chair.
 The Potions Master loomed tall by the fireplace.
 “
\emph on
But he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not… and either must destroy
 all but a remnant of the other, for those two different spirits cannot
 exist in the same world.
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That last line Severus spoke with so much foreboding that it chilled her
 bones; it was almost like listening to Sybill Trelawney.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was listening with a frown.
 “Can you repeat that?” said Harry.

This was done, with both Albus and Severus watching the parchment hawklike,
 as though to make sure that no unseen hand reached in and snatched the
 precious information away.
\end_layout

“Let's see…” Harry said.
 “I'm male and born on July 31st, check.
 I did in fact vanquish the Dark Lord, check.
 Ambiguous pronoun in line two… but I wasn't born yet so it's hard to see
 how my parents could have thrice defied 
\emph on
me.

\emph default
 This scar is an obvious candidate for the mark…” Harry touched his forehead.
 “Then there's the power the Dark Lord knows not, which probably refers
 to my scientific background

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Severus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Severus's eyes were closed, his face tightened in concentration.
 “The Dark Lord could obtain that power by studying the same books as you,
 Potter.
 But the prophecy did not say, 
\emph on
power the Dark Lord has not.

\emph default
 Nor even, 
\emph on
power the Dark Lord cannot have.

\emph default
 She spoke of 
\emph on
power the Dark Lord knows not
\emph default
… it will be something stranger to him than Muggle artifacts.
 Something perhaps that he cannot comprehend at all, even having seen it…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Science is not a bag of technological tricks,” Harry said.
 “It's not just the Muggle version of a wand.
 It's not even knowledge like memorizing the periodic table.
 It's a different way of 
\emph on
thinking.
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Perhaps…” the Potions Master murmured, but his voice was skeptical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It is hazardous,” Albus said, “to read too far into a prophecy, even if
 you have heard it yourself.
 They are things of exceeding frustration.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So I see,” Harry said.
 His hand rose up, rubbed the scar on his forehead.
 “But… okay, if 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 is really all we know… look, I'll just put it bluntly.
 How do you 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 that the Dark Lord actually survived?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
What?
\emph default
” she cried.
 Albus just sighed and leaned back in the vast Headmaster's chair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well,” Harry said, “imagine how this prophecy sounded back when it was
 made.
 You-Know-Who learns the prophecy, and it sounds like I'm destined to grow
 up and overthrow him.
 That the two of us are meant to have a final battle where either of us
 must destroy all but a remnant of the other.
 So You-Know-Who attacks Godric's Hollow and 
\emph on
immediately
\emph default
 gets vanquished, leaving behind
\emph on
 some
\emph default
 remnant which may or may not be his disembodied soul.
 Maybe the Death Eaters are his remnant, or the Dark Mark.
 This prophecy could already be fulfilled, is what I'm saying.
 Don't get me wrong 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

--
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I do realize that my interpretation sounds stretched.
 Trelawney's phrasing doesn't seem natural for describing
\emph on
 only
\emph default
 the events that historically happened on October 31st, 1981.
 Attacking a baby and having the spell bounce off, isn't something you'd
 normally call `the power to vanquish'.
 But if you think of the prophecy as being about 
\emph on
several
\emph default
 possible futures, only 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 of which was actually realized on Halloween, then the prophecy could already
 be complete.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But

” Minerva blurted.
 “But the raid on Azkaban

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
If
\emph default
 the Dark Lord survived, then sure, he's the most likely suspect for the
 Azkaban breakout,” Harry said reasonably.
 “You could even say that the Azkaban breakout is Bayesian evidence for
 the Dark Lord surviving, because an Azkaban breakout is more likely to
 happen in worlds where he's alive than worlds where he's dead.
 But it's not 
\emph on
strong
\emph default
 Bayesian evidence.
 It's not something that 
\emph on
can't possibly happen
\emph default
 unless the Dark Lord is alive.
 Professor Quirrell, who 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 start from the assumption that You-Know-Who was still around, had no trouble
 thinking of his own explanation.
 To him, it was obvious that some powerful wizard might want Bellatrix Black
 because she knew a secret of the Dark Lord's, like some of his magical
 knowledge that he'd told to only her.
 The priors against anyone surviving their body's death are very low, even
 if it's magically possible.

\emph on
 Most
\emph default
 times it doesn't happen.
 So if it's 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 the Azkaban breakout… I'd have to say formally that it isn't enough Bayesian
 evidence.
 The improbability of the evidence assuming that the hypothesis is false,
 is not commensurate with the prior improbability of the hypothesis.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” Severus said flatly.
 “The prophecy is not yet fulfilled.
 I would know if it were.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Are you 
\emph on
sure
\emph default
 of that?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, Potter.
 If the prophecy had already come true, I would
\emph on
 understand
\emph default
 it! I heard Trelawney's words, I remember Trelawney's voice, and if I knew
 the events that matched the prophecy, I would 
\emph on
recognize
\emph default
 them.
 What has already happened… does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 fit.” The Potions Master spoke with certainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm not really sure what to do with that statement,” Harry said.
 His hand rose up, absently rubbed at his forehead.
 “Maybe it's just what you 
\emph on
think
\emph default
 happened that doesn't fit, and the true history is different…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Voldemort 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 alive,” Albus said.
 “There are other indications.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Such as?” Harry's reply was instant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albus paused.
 “There are terrible rituals by which wizards have returned from death,”
 Albus said slowly.
 “That much, anyone can discern within history and legend.
 And yet those books are missing, I could not find them; it was Voldemort
 who removed them, I am sure 
\begin_inset ERT

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So you 
\emph on
can't
\emph default
 find any books on immortality, and that proves that You-Know-Who has them?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” said Albus.
 “There is a certain book

 an empty place on a shelf to show where it was 
\begin_inset ERT

” The old wizard stopped.
 “But I suppose,” the old wizard said, as though to himself, “you will say
 that even if Voldemort tried to make himself immortal, it does not prove
 that he succeeded…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry sighed.
 “Proof, Headmaster? There are only ever probabilities.
 If there are known, particular books on immortality rituals which are missing,
 that increases the probability that someone attempted one.
 Which, in turn, raises the prior probability of the Dark Lord surviving
 his death.
 This I concede, and thank you for contributing the fact.
 The question is whether the prior probability goes up 
\emph on
enough.
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Surely,” Albus said quietly, “if you concede even a
\emph on
 chance
\emph default
 that Voldemort survived, that is worth guarding against?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry inclined his head.
 “As you say, Headmaster.
 Though once a probability drops low enough, it's also an error to go on
 obsessing about it… Given that books on immortality are missing, and that
 this prophecy would sound 
\emph on
somewhat
\emph default
 more natural if it refers to the Dark Lord and I having a future battle,
 I agree that the Dark Lord being alive is a probability, not just possibility.
 But other probabilities must 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 be taken into account 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

--
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and in the probable worlds where You-Know-Who is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 alive, someone else framed Hermione.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Foolishness,” Severus said softly.
 “Utter foolishness.
 The Dark Mark has not faded, nor has its master.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“See, 
\emph on
that's
\emph default
 what I mean by formally insufficient Bayesian evidence.
 Sure, it sounds all grim and foreboding and stuff, but is it 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 unlikely for a magical mark to stay around after the maker dies? Suppose
 the mark is certain to continue while the Dark Lord's sentience lives on,
 but 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
 we'd only have guessed a twenty percent chance of the Dark Mark continuing
 to exist after the Dark Lord dies.
 Then the observation, `The Dark Mark has not faded' is five times as likely
 to occur in worlds where the Dark Lord is alive as in worlds where the
 Dark Lord is dead.
 Is that really commensurate with the prior improbability of immortality?
 Let's say the prior odds were a hundred-to-one against the Dark Lord surviving.
 If a hypothesis is a hundred times as likely to be false versus true, and
 then you see evidence five times more likely if the hypothesis is true
 versus false, you should update to believing the hypothesis is twenty times
 as likely to be false as true.
 Odds of a hundred to one, times a likelihood ratio of one to five, equals
 odds of twenty to one that the Dark Lord is dead

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Where
\emph default
 are you getting all these numbers, Potter?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 the admitted weakness of the method,” Harry said readily.
 “But what I'm 
\emph on
qualitatively
\emph default
 getting at is why the observation, `The Dark Mark has not faded', is not
 adequate support for the hypothesis, `The Dark Lord is immortal.' The evidence
 isn't as extraordinary as the claim.” Harry paused.
 “Not to mention that even if the Dark Lord is alive, he doesn't
\emph on
 have
\emph default
 to be the one who framed Hermione.
 As a cunning man once said, there could be more than one plotter and more
 than one plan.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Such as the Defense Professor,” Severus said with a thin smile.
 “I suppose I must agree that he is a suspect.
 It was the Defense Professor last year, after all; and the year before
 that, and the year before 
\emph on
that
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's eyes dropped back to the parchment in his lap.
 “Let's move on.
 Are we 
\emph on
certain
\emph default
 that this Prophecy is accurate? Nobody messed with Professor McGonagall's
 memory, maybe edited or subtracted a line?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albus paused, then spoke slowly.
 “There is a great spell laid over Britain, recording every prophecy said
 within our borders.
 Far beneath the Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in the Department
 of Mysteries, they are recorded.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The Hall of Prophecy,” Minerva whispered.
 She'd read about that place, said to be a great room of shelves filled
 with glowing orbs, one after another appearing over the years.
 Merlin himself had wrought it, it was said; the greatest wizard's final
 slap to the face of Fate.
 Not all prophecies conduced to the good; and Merlin had wished for at least
 those spoken of in prophecy, to know what had been spoken 
\emph on
of
\emph default
 them.
 That was the respect Merlin had given to their free will, that Destiny
 might not control them from the outside, unwitting.
 Those mentioned within a prophecy would have an glowing orb float to their
 hand, and then hear the prophet's true voice speaking.
 Others who tried to touch an orb, it was said, would be driven mad 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 or possibly just have their heads explode, the legends were unclear on
 this point.
 Whatever Merlin's original intention, the Unspeakables hadn't let anyone
 enter in centuries, so far as she'd heard.
 
\emph on
Works of the Ancient Wizards
\emph default
 had stated that later Unspeakables had discovered that tipping off the
 subjects of prophecies could interfere with seers releasing whatever temporal
 pressures they released; and so the heirs of Merlin had sealed his Hall.
 It did occur to Minerva to wonder (now that she'd spent a few months around
 Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

Potter) how anyone could possibly 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 that; but she also knew better than to ask Albus, in case Albus tried to
 tell her.
 Minerva firmly believed that you only ought to worry about Time if you
 were a clock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The Hall of Prophecy,” Albus confirmed lowly.
 “Those who are spoken of in a prophecy, may listen to that prophecy there.
 Do you see the implication, Harry?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry frowned.
 “Well, I could listen to it, or the Dark Lord… oh, my 
\emph on
parents
\emph default
.
 Those who had thrice defied him.
 They were also mentioned in the prophecy, so they could hear the recording?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“If James and Lily heard anything different from what Minerva reported,”
 Albus said evenly, “they did not say so to me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You took James and Lily 
\emph on
there?
\emph default
” Minerva said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fawkes can go to many places,” Albus said.
 “Do not mention the fact.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was staring directly at Albus.
 “Can 
\emph on
I
\emph default
 go to this Department of Mysteries place and hear the recorded prophecy?
 The original tone of voice might be helpful, from what I've heard.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Light glinted from the reflection of Albus's half-moon glasses as the old
 wizard slowly shook his head.
 “I think that would be unwise,” Albus said.
 “For reasons beyond the obvious.
 It is dangerous, that place which Merlin made; more dangerous to some people
 than others.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see,” Harry said tonelessly, and looked back down at the parchment.
 “I'll take the prophecy as assumed accurate for now.
 The next part says that the Dark Lord has marked me as his equal.
 Any ideas on what that means exactly?”

 The Order survived my folly only because Alastor did not trust in the bare

 I had thought, afterward, that the bearers of the Mark might hide it or
 show it at their will.
 And yet when we hied Igor Karkaroff before the Wizengamot, that Mark showed
 clear on his arm, for all that Karkaroff wished to protest his innocence.
 What true rule may govern the Dark Mark, I do not know.

 “Headmaster, I can now speak freely of the Mark.
 If we know we are caught for a Death Eater, before others who have not

Requiring that level of intelligence was an additional burdensome detail;
 prior odds of a random population member being that intelligent were low…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Lord Voldemort wasn't a randomly selected wizard, he was one particular
 wizard in the population who'd come to everyone's attention.
 The puzzle of the Mark implied a certain minimum level of intelligence,
 even if (hypothetically) the Dark Lord had taken longer to think it through.
 Then again, in the Muggle world, all of the extremely intelligent people
 Harry knew about from history had
\emph on
 not
\emph default
 become evil dictators or terrorists.
 The closest thing to that in the Muggle world was hedge-fund managers,
 and none of
\emph on
 them
\emph default
 had tried to take over so much as a third-world country, a point which
 put upper bounds on both their possible evil and possible goodness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were hypotheses where the Dark Lord was smart and the Order of the
 Phoenix 
\emph on
didn't
\emph default
 just instantly die, but those hypotheses were more complicated and ought
 to get complexity penalties.
 After the complexity penalties of the further excuses were factored in,
 there would be a large likelihood ratio from the hypotheses `The Dark Lord
 is smart' versus `The Dark Lord was stupid' to the observation, `The Dark
 Lord did not instantly win the war'.
 That was probably worth a 10:1 likelihood ratio in favor of the Dark Lord
 being stupid… but maybe not 100:1.
 You couldn't actually say that `The Dark Lord instantly wins' had a probability
 of 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 than 99 percent, assuming the Dark Lord started out smart; the sum over
 all possible excuses would be more than .01.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there was the Prophecy… which might or might not have
\emph on
 originally
\emph default
 included a line about how Lord Voldemort would
\emph on
 immediately
\emph default
 die if he confronted the Potters.
 Which Albus Dumbledore had then edited in Professor McGonagall's memory,
 in order to lure Lord Voldemort to his doom.
 If there 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 no such line, the Prophecy did sound 
\emph on
somewhat
\emph default
 more like You-Know-Who and the Boy-Who-Lived were destined to have some
 later confrontation.
 But in 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 case, it was less likely that Dumbledore would've come up with a plausible-soun
ding excuse not to take Harry to the Hall of Prophecy…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was wondering if he could even 
\emph on
get
\emph default
 a Bayesian calculation out of this.
 Of course, the point of a subjective Bayesian calculation wasn't that,
 after you made up a bunch of numbers, multiplying them out would give you
 an exactly right answer.
 The real point was that the 
\emph on
process
\emph default
 of making up numbers would force you to tally all the relevant facts and
 weigh all the relative probabilities.
 Like realizing, as soon as you actually 
\emph on
thought
\emph default
 about the probability of the Dark Mark not-fading 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 You-Know-Who 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 dead, that the probability wasn't low enough for the observation to count
 as strong evidence.
 One version of the process was to tally hypotheses and list out evidence,
 make up all the numbers, do the calculation, and then throw out the final
 answer and go with your brain's gut feeling 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 you'd forced it to really 
\emph on
weigh
\emph default
 everything.
 The trouble was that the items of evidence weren't conditionally independent,
 and there were multiple interacting background facts of interest…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…well, 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 thing at least was certain.

There was a blur of motion as the resolving figure snapped up a wand, smoothly

In the first instant that Harry saw that man, before Harry even took in

 the man had been burned and cut over his entire body; though only the man's

 The rest of the man's body was hidden, encased not in robes, but in leather

 the man's mess of grayed hair.

 occupying the right side of the man's face.

And another part of his mind noticed the jolt of adrenaline.
 Harry had drawn his wand in sheer reflex when the man had spun out of the

\emph on
ambush,
\emph default
 Harry's hand had already started to level his wand for a

 before he'd managed to stop himself.
 Even now the armored man was holding his wand level, not pointed at any

 in perfect line with his eyes, like a soldier sighting down a gun.
 There was danger in the man's stance and the set of his boots, danger in
 the leather armor he wore and danger in that brilliant blue eye.

“If Harry Potter is not our friend,” Dumbledore said gravely, “then we are

The man's wand stayed level, not quite pointing at Harry.
 “Boy almost drew on me just then.”

“Er…” Harry said.
 He noticed that his hand was still tightly holding the wand, and consciously
 relaxed his hand and dropped it back to his side.
 “Sorry about that, you looked a bit… combat-ready.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scarred man's wand moved slightly away from where it had almost pointed
 at Harry, though it didn't lower, and the man let out a short bark of laughter.
 “Constant vigilance, eh, lad?” said the man.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you,” Harry recited the
 proverb.

 “Not all of it good.

\begin_layout Standard
After some consideration, Harry decided to reply with a knowing smile.

“How'd you pull off that one, boy?” the man said softly.
 Now his blue eye was fixed on Harry as well.
 “I had a little chat with one of the Aurors who escorted the Dementor there

 Beth Martin said it came straight from the pit, and no-one gave it any
 special instructions along the way.
 Of course, she could be lying.”

“Voldie's host,” Moody said shortly.

“So the obvious question is who's gained too much power too quickly,” Moody

 “And it turns out that there's a fellow who's gone and banished the Bandon

“Dear me,” murmured Dumbledore.
 “Are you certain that he is not relying on his own skills?”

\begin_layout Standard
“Checked his grades,” Moody said.
 “Record shows Gilderoy Lockhart received a Troll in his Defense O.W.L.S., didn't
 bother with the N.E.W.T.
 Just the sort of sucker to take the deal Voldie was offering.” The blue
 eye whirled crazily within its socket.
 “Unless you remember Lockhart as a student, and think he had enough potential
 to do all that by himself?”
\end_layout

“No,” said Professor McGonagall.
 She frowned.

 “He… wasn't available.
 Well, I'd decided it was worth risking five House points, and if you say

 I had no idea what it would even

 And then I still didn't see how I could hit you, when you were moving that

 Anyway, the Professor says he left the duelling circuit before he got a
 chance to use that spell, since it only works as a finishing move on an
 unshielded opponent.
 The hex gets as close to the target as possible along its original trajectory,
 and then once it detects that the target is getting more distant again,
 the hex turns in midair and heads straight for the target.
 It can only swerve once

 but the incantation sounds very close to `Stupefy' and the hex is the same

 a normal dodge, that midair retargeting will finish them off.

 “Love is real, Professor, a phenomenon with observable effects.
 Brains are real, emotions are real, and love is as much a part of the real

The Defense Professor did not react to this at all.

Harry continued.
 “From what Draco says, Lucius prioritized him over important Wizengamot

 That's significant evidence, since there's less expensive ways to fake
 love, if you just want to fake it.
 And it's not like the prior probability of a parent loving their child

 You

 And to answer your question, boy, there's two reasons why that spell's

 Straight through shields.

 it.
 You've got to

 Killing Grice didn't bring back Blair Roche, or Nathan Rehfuss, or David

 It wasn't for justice, or to stop him doing it again.

You can't want the person dead as an instrumental value on the way to some

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody shook his head slightly.
 “One of the dark truths of the Killing Curse, son, is that once you've

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It damages the mind?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again Moody shook his head.
 “No.

 Murder tears the soul

 The Killing Curse doesn't crack your soul.
 It just takes a cracked soul to cast.” If there was a sad expression on

 And no other spell could've gone past the Dark Lord's shields; you'd have

 He supposed he had no right to expect Professor McGonagall to say anything

 In a moral dilemma where you lost something either way, making the choice
 would

feel
\emph default
 bad either way, so you could temporarily save yourself a little mental
 pain by refusing to decide.
 At the cost of not being able to plan anything in advance, and at the cost

 you couldn't expect a witch to know all that.
 “All right,” Harry said.

Though it wasn't right at all, not really.
 Dumbledore might want that debt removed, Professor Quirrell would also
 want Harry out of that debt.
 And if the Defense Professor

 Just because you lost something might not mean the payment was returned,

 It had been Severus's acts which had brought about the prophecy's fulfillment.
