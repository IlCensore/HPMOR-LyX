Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence
 in 1956.
 It had been the first conference ever on the topic, the one that had coined
 the phrase

Artificial Intelligence".
 They had identified key problems such as making computers understand language,
 learn, and improve themselves.
 They had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on
 these problems might be made by ten scientists working together for two
 months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
No.
 Chin up.
 You're just
\emph default
 starting
\emph on

 You don't actually
\emph default

\emph on
 whether it's going to be too difficult to do in two months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

And you
\emph on
 really
\emph default

 this sort of scientific experimenting?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Harry asked again.
 It just seemed so
\emph on
 obvious
\emph default
 to him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then again, it'd taken more than two hundred years
\emph on
 after
\emph default
 the invention of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists had
 thought to systematically investigate which sentences a
\emph on
 human four-year-old
\emph default
 could or couldn't understand.
 The developmental psychology of linguistics could've been discovered in
 the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one had even thought to look
 until the twentieth.
 So you couldn't really blame the much smaller wizarding world for not investiga
ting the Retrieval Charm.

But‚Ä¶ in the wizarding world‚Ä¶
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd all ended their Muggle educations
 at the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall might be biased, but she
 had claimed that Hogwarts was the largest and most eminent wizarding school
 in the world‚Ä¶ and it only educated up to the age of seventeen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how you went

 But she seemed to have literally never

 To her it was just Muggle magic.
 And she didn't even seem
\emph on
 curious
\emph default
 about what secrets might be hiding behind the natural language understanding
 of the Retrieval Charm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That left two possibilities, really.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and impenetrable,
 that even though wizards and witches had tried their best to understand,
 they'd made little or no progress and eventually given up; and Harry would
 do no better.

\begin_layout Standard
Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made a quiet

 Diagon Alley.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Possibility two: He'd be taking over the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually.
 Perhaps not right away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That sort of thing
\emph on
 did
\emph default
 sometimes take longer than two months.
 Muggle science hadn't gone to the moon in the first week after Galileo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Harry still couldn't stop the huge smile that was stretching his cheeks
 so wide they were starting to hurt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies
 that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting
 about how far ahead they'd been at age ten.
 But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either.
 There were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein for every
 actual Einstein in history.
 Because those other geniuses hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing
 you absolutely needed to achieve greatness.
 They'd never found an important problem.
\end_layout

 Harry thought at the walls of Diagon Alley, and all the shops and items,
 and all the shopkeepers and customers; and all the lands and people of
 wizarding Britain, and all the wider wizarding world; and the entire greater
 universe of which Muggle scientists understood so much less than they believed.

Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit, the Emergency

 There were two self-tightening tourniquets.
 A Stabilisation Potion, which would slow blood loss and prevent shock.
 A syringe of what looked like liquid fire, which was supposed to drastically
 slow circulation in a treated area while maintaining oxygenation of the
 blood for up to three minutes, if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading
 through the body.
 White cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to temporarily
 numb pain.
 Plus any number of other items that Harry totally failed to comprehend,
 like the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared
 to reality.
 Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or they
 say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years.
 For example, in one experiment, they asked students for times by which
 they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they'd complete their homework,
 and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students finished by those times.
 And they found that the reason was that when they asked one group for their
 best-case estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another
 group for their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they
 got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable.
 See, if you ask someone what they expect in the
\emph on
 normal
\emph default
 case, they visualise what looks like the line of maximum probability at
 each step along the way 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 everything going according to plan, with no surprises.
 But actually, since more than half the students didn't finish by the time
 they were 99% sure they'd be done, reality usually delivers results a little
 worse than the 'worst-case scenario'.
 It's called the planning fallacy, and the best way to fix it is to ask
 how long things took the last time you tried them.
 That's called using the outside view instead of the inside view.
 But when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just have to
 be really, really, really pessimistic.
 Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out
\emph on
 better
\emph default
 than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out worse.
 It's actually
\emph on
 really hard
\emph default
 to be
\emph on
 so
\emph default
 pessimistic that you stand a decent chance of
\emph on
 undershooting
\emph default
 real life.
 Like I make this big effort to be gloomy and I imagine one of my classmates
 getting bitten, but what actually happens is that the surviving Death Eaters
 attack the whole school to get at me.

 tentacles from its bottom and squirm after its owner.
 A trunk with two drawers on each of four sides that each slid out to reveal
 compartments as deep as the whole trunk.
