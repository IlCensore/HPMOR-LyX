 was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in preparatio

 from her, when Harry Potter walked into the Ravenclaw common room; and
 it was only then that she realized, she hadn't seen him at all since breakfast.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry's shoulder, a bright bird
 of fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry looked sad and worn and really 
\emph on
tired
\emph default
 like the phoenix was the only thing keeping him on his feet, but there
 was still a warmth about him, if you crossed your eyes you might have thought
 you were looking at the Headmaster somehow, that was the impression that
 went through Hermione's mind even though it didn't make any sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofas full of
 staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys, heading for her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In theory she wasn't talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn't up until
 tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a

“Fawkes,” Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, “that girl over
 there is Hermione Granger, she's not talking to me right now because I'm
 an idiot, but if you want to be on a good person's shoulder she's better
 than me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter's voice

\begin_layout Standard
But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix had glided
 off Harry's shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fast-forward,
 flashing toward her; there was a phoenix flying in front of her and staring
 at her with eyes of light and flame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Caw?
\emph default
” asked the phoenix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a test
 she'd forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she'd
 gone her whole life without studying for it, she couldn't find anything
 to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one wingtip like
 the being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter's
 shoulder, where it settled down quite firmly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You silly boy,” said Padma across from her, looking like she was deciding
 whether to laugh or grimace, “phoenixes aren't for smart girls who do their
 homework, they're for idiots who charge straight at five older Slytherin
 bullies.
 There's a reason why the Gryffindor colors are red and gold, you know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione wasn't one of the laughing ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither was Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had put a hand over his face.
 “Tell Hermione I'm sorry,” he said to Padma, his voice almost fallen to
 a whisper.
 “Tell her I forgot that phoenixes are animals, they don't understand time
 and planning, they don't understand people who are

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began slowly trudging
 toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Hermione couldn't leave it at that, she just 
\emph on
couldn't
\emph default
 leave it at that.
 She didn't know if it was her competition with Harry or something else.
 She just couldn't leave it with the phoenix turning away from her.

“I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!” she
 shouted a little desperately at the red-golden bird.
 “I mean, I actually did start running and everything! That was stupid and
 courageous, right?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry's shoulder again,
 back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her three times like
 she was the center of an inferno, and for just a moment its wing brushed
 against her cheek, before the phoenix soared back to Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Told you so,” Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing the stairs
 up to his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he was very light
 on his feet for some reason, so that in just a moment he and Fawkes were
 gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had brushed
 her with his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that one small
 patch of skin had been very gently set on fire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She'd answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it felt to
 her like she'd just barely squeaked by on the test, like she'd gotten a
 62 and she could've gotten 104 if she'd tried harder.

Aftermath, Fawkes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and howling hurricanes
 of emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being laid down into memory,
 and in that fashion, perhaps, becoming part of the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next night, they would come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire, Hogwarts was on
 fire, his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford were on fire, all ablaze
 with golden flames that shone but did not consume, and all the people walking
 through the blazing streets were shining with white light brighter than
 the fire, like they were flames themselves, or stars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for themselves, the wonder
 whose rumor they had already heard, that in his bed Harry Potter lay silent
 and motionless, a gentle smile on his face, while perched on his pillow
 a red-golden bird watched over him, with bright wings swept above him like
 a blanket pulled over his head.

The reckoning had been put off one more night.

Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was straight.
 He waved his wand over his own head and said a Charm that Father had taught
 him while other children were still playing in mud, a Charm which ensured
 that not a single speck of lint or dust would dirty his wizard's robes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him, and tucked
 it into his robes.
 He had already used

Incendio

 and 
\emph on
Everto

 on the mysterious note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly the same
 tick of the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, so that
 it would seem like all others had been waiting on his appearance to eat.
 Because when you were the scion of Malfoy you were first in everything,
 including breakfast, that was why.

\begin_layout Standard
Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his private
 room, up even before he was

\begin_layout Standard
The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this early was
 heading straight to breakfast anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty and echoing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few arrivals,
 some younger children crying, students running back and forth between tables
 or standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefect was standing
 in front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at them and Snape was
 striding toward the mess

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some of the
 faces turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The food appeared on the tables.
 No one looked at it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed straight toward
 Draco.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A knot of fear clutched at Draco's heart, had something happened to Father

\begin_layout Standard
There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw as their Head
 of House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharp dresser
 (that was an understatement) but his robes were even dirtier and more disarraye
d this morning, spotted with extra grease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You haven't heard?” hissed their Head of House as he came close.
 “For pity's sake, Malfoy, don't you have a newspaper delivered?”

“What is it, Profe-”

“Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!”

“

 have and Vincent just gasped.

Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly.
 “Lucius told you nothing, then.

“Then I

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn't know why he
 was bothering, of course they looked even more confused than he did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at the far
 end, which was still empty of sitters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with automatic
 motions.

\begin_layout Standard
Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.

\begin_layout Standard
Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban…?

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh, really?” said an incensed voice from behind Draco.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer,
 the one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they
 weren't and yes, that mattered.
 Draco said in their general direction, certainly not deigning to address

them

 in particular, “There's Death Eaters and then there's Death Eaters,” and
 then turned back to his food.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoes stormed
 off toward the other end of the Slytherin table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them, visibly
 out of breath, and said, “Mr.

A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across from him and
 William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincent nudged him
 and said, “There.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.

\begin_layout Standard
Draco watched him closely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no alarm on Harry's face as he saw, no surprise or shock, he just
 looked…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he was trying
 to figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn't understand yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table, saying
 “Stay behind,” and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry.

Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turning toward

 plausible deniability.

Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause.

Harry said, “Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?”

 “What are you going to tell him?”

“Surprised,” Harry said flatly.
 “Yeah.

 He knew he needed to go off and think about things, but there was a tiny

 That wasn't very private, but it should be private enough, and Harry didn't

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if you wanted to
 communicate with someone without anyone else knowing that the two of you
 had talked.
 The sender gave an envelope to someone who had a reputation for being a
 reliable messenger, along with ten Knuts; that first person would take
 five Knuts and pass the envelope to another messenger along with the other
 five Knuts, and the second messenger would open up that envelope and find
 another envelope with a name written on it and deliver that envelope to
 that person.
 That way neither of the two people passing the message knew both the sender

\emph on
Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the services of
 a most erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H.
 Lyall, whom Moody mistrusted slightly less than average because Moody had
 refrained from reporting him as an unregistered werewolf; and he had paid
 Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye, and every known hint
 to their location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn't bothered reading most of
 it; because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating back to
 an era before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark
 Wizard ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn't in Britain
 or anywhere else he'd have to worry about silly rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired the Eye of
 Vance, and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberated for a period
 of around two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved in on the power vacuum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had decided
 against it after he realized that would be 
\emph on
just what they were expecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying the graveyard
 of Little Hangleton.
 It should have been a lot gloomier, that place, but in the broad daylight
 it seemed like nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary tombstones,
 demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal that
 Muggles used instead of wards.
 (Moody could not comprehend what the Muggles were thinking on that score,
 if they were 
\emph on
pretending
\emph default
 to have wards, or what, and he had decided not to ask whether Muggle criminals
 respected the pretense.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody didn't actually 
\emph on
need
\emph default
 to turn to survey the graveyard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every direction around
 him, no matter where it was pointing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater like Severus
 Snape know that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes people called Moody `paranoid'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting Dark Wizards
 and then get back to him about that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in retrospect,
 to achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution

 and had begun to suspect that most people died before they got there.
 Moody had once expressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering
 and figuring, and told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die,
 on average, eight and a half times along the way to becoming `paranoid'.
 This explained a great deal, assuming Lyall wasn't lying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark Lord had
 used unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, and was now
 awake and abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin the Wizarding War
 anew.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can't believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing,” Mad-Eye
 Moody said with considerable acerbity.
 “D'you realize how long it'll take me to do the grave of every ancestor
 of every Dark Wizard I've ever killed who could've been smart enough to
 make a horcrux? You're not just 
\emph on
now
\emph default
 doing this one, are you?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I redose this one every year,” Severus Snape said calmly, uncapping the
 third flask of what the man had 
\emph on
claimed
\emph default
 would be seventeen bottles, and beginning to wave his wand over it.
 “The other ancestral graves we've been able to locate were poisoned with
 only the long-lasting substances, since some of us have less free time
 than yourself.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing, to appear
 within the bones where marrow had once been.
 “But you think it's worth the effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing
 the bones.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“He 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 have other avenues to life, should he perceive this one blocked,” Snape
 said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle.
 “And before you ask, it must be the original grave, the place of first
 burial, the bone removed during the ritual and not before.
 Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also there is no point in
 substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor.
 He would notice it had lost all potency.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Who else knows about this trap?” Moody demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You.
 Me.
 The Headmaster.
 No one else.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody snorted.
 “Pfah.
 Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that McGonagall woman about the resurrect
ion ritual?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes

“If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual and

, Voldie'll figure that Albus told

me,
\emph default
 and Voldie 
\emph on

\emph default
 I'd think of this.” Moody shook his head in disgust.
 “What're these other ways Voldie could come back to life?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Snape's hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, of course,
 the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less than nothing
 to Moody, it just marked you in his Eye's sight as trying-to-hide), and
 the former Death Eater said, “You don't need to know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You're learning, son,” said Moody with mild approval.
 “What's in the bottles?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin the substance
 flowing toward the grave, and said, “This one? A Muggle narcotic called
 LSD.
 A conversation yesterday put me in mind of Muggle things, and LSD seemed
 the most interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some.
 If it is incorporated into the resurrection potion, I suspect its effects
 will be permanent.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What does it do?” said Moody.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone who has
 not used it,” drawled Snape, “and I have not used it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask.
 “What about that one?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Love potion.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“Love potion?

” said Moody.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not of the standard sort.
 It is meant to trigger a two-way bond with an unbearably sweet Veela woman
 named Verdandi who the Headmaster hopes might be able to redeem even him,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Second flask.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Iocane powder.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bahl's Stupefaction,” Moody said, naming an extremely addictive narcotic
 with interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody
 had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a
 victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having
 someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and
 after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the

further
\emph default
 effort to lay a 
\emph on
second Portus,
\emph default
 on the 
\emph on
same portkey,
\emph default
 which had, on a second touch, transported the victim back to safety.
 To this day, even taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine
 what could have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time
 he had cast the second Portus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Tenth vial,” said Snape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Basilisk venom,” offered Moody.
\end_layout

Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning, surveying

“Because it says `Tom Riddle' on the easily moved headstone,” Snape said
 dryly.
 “And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, who bet you would
 think of that before the fifth bottle.
 So much for constant vigilance.”

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause.

“How long did it take Albus to reali-”

“Three years after we learned of the ritual,” said Snape, in a tone not
 quite like his usual sardonic drawl.
 “In retrospect, we should have consulted you earlier.”

Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.

If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other people around,

\begin_layout Standard
If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other people around,

There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed.
 In fact you probably couldn't think of anywhere 
\emph on
better

Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure.
 He'd been too embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start calculating
 expected utilities, he'd worried that Professor Quirrell would stop respecting
 him if he said no or even hesitated too much to help a maiden in distress.

 never got another chance to be a hero…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…yeah, that had been it.
 In retrospect, that had been it.
 He'd gone and started thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot
 twist, as opposed to, oh, say, here was a proposal to 
\emph on
break Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban.

\emph default
 That had been the true and original reason for the decision in the split
 second where it had been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative
 where he said `no' as dissonant.
 And when you thought about it, that wasn't a rational way to make decisions.
 Professor Quirrell's ulterior motive to obtain the last remains of Slytherin's
 lost lore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably forgotten, seemed
 impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with what had appeared
 at the time as a small risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It didn't seem fair, it didn't seem 
\emph on
fair
\emph default
, that 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 was what happened if he lost his grip on his rationality for just a tiny
 fraction of a second, the tiny fraction of a second required for his brain
 to decide to be more comfortable with `yes' arguments than `no' arguments
 during the discussion that had followed.

 want to confess and ruin his reputation forever and get everyone angry

 He'd rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six years than face that.
 That was how he felt.
 And so it was in fact helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single
 decisive factor, which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell
 would go to Azkaban and die there.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Really?
\emph default
 inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen million experimental
 results about people being too optimistic and overconfident.
 
\emph on
Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations
 routinely

reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he's unique.
 Which one of you two planned the perfect crime, and
\emph default

 if a problem it truly was, and not the superior wisdom of experience.
 But to Harry it looked like Professor Quirrell was constantly interpreting
 everything in the worst possible light.
 If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass that was 90% full, he'd tell you
 that the 10% empty part proved that no one 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 cared about water.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it.
 Not all of magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well over half
 full…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…although, 
\emph on
following
\emph default
 the analogy, if Azkaban existed, then maybe it 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 prove that the 90% good part was there for other reasons, people trying
 to 
\emph on
make a show of kindness
\emph default
 as Professor Quirrell had put it.
 For if they were truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would
 storm the fortress to tear it down… wouldn't they?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.
 If you wanted to be a rationalist you had to read an awful lot of papers
 on flaws in human nature, and some of those flaws were innocent logical
 failures, and some of them looked a lot darker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgram experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World War II, to
 try to understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So he had designed an experiment to investigate 
\emph on
obedience,
\emph default
 to see if Germans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders
 from authority figures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First he'd run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects, as
 a control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And afterward he hadn't bothered trying it in Germany.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontal line,
 with labels starting at `15 volts' and going up to `450 volts', with labels
 for each group of four switches.
 The first group of four labeled `Slight Shock', the sixth group labeled
 `Extreme Intensity Shock', the seventh group labeled `Danger: Severe Shock',
 and the two last switches left over labeled just `XXX'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appeared to the
 true subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the
 same ad for participants in an experiment on learning, and who had lost
 a (rigged) lottery and been strapped into a chair, along with the electrodes.
 The true experimental subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrode
s, just so that they could see that it worked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effects of
 punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was to see
 if it made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment;
 and that the person strapped to the chair would try to memorize sets of
 word pairs, and that each time the `learner' got one wrong, the `teacher'
 was to administer a successively stronger shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answers and
 begin kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct
 the subjects to treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After that nothing would be heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter,
 maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat, would
 say `Please continue', then `The experiment requires that you continue',
 then `It is absolutely essential that you continue', then `You have no
 other choice, you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 go on'.
 If the fourth prod still didn't work, the experiment halted there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup,
 and then asked fourteen psychology seniors what percentage of subjects
 
\emph on
they
\emph default
 thought would go all the way up to the 450-volt level, what percentage
 of subjects would press the last of the two switches marked XXX, after
 the victim had stopped responding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The actual number had been 26 out of 40.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten
 their lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh.
 But at the experimenter's prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administer
ing what they believed to be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical
 shocks.
 All the way to the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense Professor
's voice saying something along the lines of: 
\emph on
Why, Mr.
\emph default

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph on
Potter, even I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most
 cherished principles for money and power, but I did not realize that a
 stern look also sufficed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if you weren't
 a professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry had read about
 the Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to him that situations
 like this had probably arisen many times in the ancestral environment,
 and that most potential ancestors who'd tried to disobey Authority were
 dead.
 Or that they had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient.
 People 
\emph on
thought
\emph default
 themselves good and moral, but when push came to shove, some switch flipped
 in their brain, and it was suddenly a lot harder to heroically defy Authority
 than they thought.
 Even if you could do it, it wouldn't be easy, it wouldn't be some effortless
 display of heroism.
 You would tremble, your voice would break, you would be afraid; would you
 be able to defy Authority even then?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connection between
 Milgram's experiment and what Hermione had done on her first day of Defense
 class, she'd refused to shoot a fellow student, even when Authority had
 told her that she must, she had trembled and been afraid but she had still
 refused.
 Harry had seen that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still
 hadn't made the connection until now…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking lower, the
 sky fading, darkening, even if most of it was still blue, soon it would
 turn to night.
 The gold and red colors of Sun and sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and Harry
 wondered, for a moment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and
 call and cry and scream without being heeded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he would always
 be reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire, and despairing over
 Azkaban belonged to the darkness just as much as did Azkaban itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that was the way
 reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you still had a choice
 of how to 
\emph on
feel
\emph default
 about it, whether you would despair over the empty half or rejoice in the
 water that was there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only needed to
 call out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair, and record
 the answers, while someone 
\emph on
else
\emph default
 pressed the switches.
 It was the same apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed
 by silence; but it wasn't 
\emph on
you
\emph default
 pressing the switch.
 
\emph on
You
\emph default
 just watched it happen, and read the questions to the person being tortured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experiment to
 the end, the 450-volt end marked `XXX'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical
 about that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But 3 out of 40 subjects had 
\emph on
refused
\emph default
 to participate all the way to the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hermiones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn't fire a Simple Strike
 Hex at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered them to do
 it.
 The ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals in their attics
 during the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did they have
 some extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry,
 which lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely, given the
 logic of sexual reproduction which said that the genes for complex machinery
 would be scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same parts inside
 them somewhere…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…well, that was a nice thought but it wasn't 
\emph on
strictly
\emph default
 true, there was such a thing as literal brain damage, people could 
\emph on
lose
\emph default
 genes and the complex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths
 and psychopaths, people who lacked the gear to care.
 Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like that, or maybe he had known good
 and yet still chosen evil; at this point it didn't matter in the slightest.
 But a 
\emph on
supermajority
\emph default
 of the population ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and
 Holocaust resisters did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who had trembled
 and sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the way to pressing
 the switches marked `XXX', many of them had written to thank Milgram, afterward
, for what they had learned about themselves.
 That, too, was part of the story, the legend of that legendary experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip peeking
 above the faraway tops of trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed to be proof
 against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at it without damaging
 his eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light that was not
 obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3 parts out of 40,
 the other 37 parts were there somewhere.
 The 7.5% of the glass that was full, which proved that people really did
 care about water, even if that force of caring within themselves was too
 often defeated.
 If people truly didn't care, the glass would have been truly empty.
 If everyone had been like You-Know-Who inside, secretly cleverly selfish,
 there would have been no resisters to the Holocaust at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his life, and
 knew that he had switched sides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because he couldn't believe in it any more, he couldn't really, not after
 going to Azkaban.
 He couldn't do what 37 out of 40 people would vote for him to do.
 Everyone might have inside them what it took to be Hermione, and someday
 they might learn; but 
\emph on
someday
\emph default
 wasn't 
\emph on
now
\emph default
, not here, not today, not in the real world.
 If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you weren't a political
 majority, and Professor Quirrell had been right, Harry would not bow his
 head in submission when that happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it.
 You shouldn't go to Azkaban and come back having not changed your mind
 about anything important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
So is Professor Quirrell right, then?
\emph default
 asked Slytherin.
 
\emph on
Leaving out whether he's good or evil, is he
\emph default
 right? 
\emph on
Are you, to them, whether they know it or not, their next Lord? We'll just
 leave out the Dark part, that's him being cynical again.
 But is it your intention now to rule? I've got to say, that makes even
\emph default
 me 
\emph on
nervous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Do you think you can be trusted with power?
\emph default
 said Gryffindor.
 
\emph on
Isn't there some sort of rule that people who want power shouldn't have
 it? Maybe we should make Hermione the ruler instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Do you think you're fit to run a society and not have it collapse into total
 chaos inside of three weeks flat?
\emph default
 said Hufflepuff.
 
\emph on
Imagine how loudly Mum would scream if she'd heard you'd been elected Prime
 Minister, now ask yourself, are you sure she's wrong about that?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Actually,
\emph default
 said Ravenclaw, 
\emph on
I have to point out that all this political stuff sounds overwhelmingly
 boring.
 How about if we leave all the electioneering to Draco and stick to science?
 It's what we're actually good at, and that's been known to improve the
 human condition too, y'know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Slow down,
\emph default
 thought Harry at his components, 
\emph on
we don't have to decide everything right now.
 We're allowed to ponder the problem as fully as possible before coming
 to a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were, which side
 you were on, of having 
\emph on
not already made up your mind
\emph default
 about something as major as that, there was an unfamiliar sensation of
 freedom in it…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his last question,
 which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made it hard once more
 to breathe, started that burning sensation in Harry's throat, sent his
 thoughts around that loop of the climbing spiral once again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor Quirrell? Harry
 was used to knowing himself, and he didn't know why he felt so sad…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in Azkaban,
 that was how it felt.
 As surely as if the Defense Professor had been eaten by Dementors, consumed
 in the empty voids.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra and there was
 in fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn't see it for a couple
 of hours? Why can't things go back to the way they were?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But then it hadn't 
\emph on
been
\emph default
 the Avada Kedavra.
 That might have played a part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of
 rationalizations and flinches and carefully not thinking about certain
 things.
 But it hadn't been the Avada Kedavra, that hadn't been the disturbing thing
 that Harry had seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
What did I see…?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked at the fading sky.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while facing
 the Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been effortless,
 and complete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another woman had known the Defense Professor as `Jeremy Jaffe'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
How many different people are you, anyway?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You couldn't help but wonder…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…whether `Professor Quirrell' was just one more name on the list, just one
 more person that had been 
\emph on
turned into
\emph default
, made up in the service of some unguessable goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to Professor Quirrell,
 if it was a mask, and what motive was behind that mask.
 With every dry smile, Harry would be trying to see what was pulling the
 levers on the lips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get too Slytherin?
 If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able to smile at anyone again,
 without them wondering what I really mean by it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface appearances and make
 a normal human relationship possible again, but Harry couldn't think of
 what it might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person, but the…
 connection…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why did that hurt so much?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why did it feel so lonely, now?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust and befriend?
 Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, not to mention
 Mum and Dad, it wasn't like Harry was 
\emph on
alone…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A choking sensation grew in Harry's throat as he understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, they all
 of them sometimes knew things that Harry didn't, but…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They did not excel above Harry 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 his own sphere of power; such genius as they possessed was not like his
 genius, and his genius was not like theirs; he might look upon them as
 peers, but not look 
\emph on
up
\emph default
 to them as his 
\emph on
superiors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of them had been, none of them could ever be…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's mentor…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was who Professor Quirrell had been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was who Harry had lost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or might not
 allow Harry to ever get him back.
 Maybe someday he would know all Professor Quirrell's hidden purposes and
 the doubts between them would go away; but even if that seemed possible,
 it didn't seem very probable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty trees, rippled
 the lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a whispering sound as it
 slid past the window that looked upon the half-twilit world, and Harry's
 thoughts wandered outward for a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Why am I different from the other children my age?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Professor Quirrell's answer to that had been an evasion, then it was
 a very well-calculated one.
 Deep enough and complex enough, sufficiently full of suggestions of hidden
 meaning, to serve as a trap for a Ravenclaw who couldn't be diverted by
 less.
 Or maybe Professor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly.
 Who knew what motive might have pulled that lever on those lips?

“That's not why I can't go to lunch with him any more,” Harry said, still

 “That was the Headmaster's decision.
 But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some things to me that made me trust
 him less, I guess…” Harry's voice sounded very shaky.
 “I'm feeling kind of alone right now.”

 Harry ground his hands against his face to wipe it, and then took his hands

Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored background
 noise as his rise broke the Quieting Charm.
 “I'm a tad sleepy so I'm going off to bed,” Harry said, now his voice was
 ordinary and wry, “I've got some lost time to make up for, but I'll see
 you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that's all right.
 Not to mention it wouldn't be fair to dump all my depression on you.
 G'night, Hermione.”

“Good night, Harry,” she said, feeling very confused and alarmed.
 “Pleasant dreams.”

I must admit, on this occasion, that Dumbledore may have a point.

 They are good people and would protect you even from Dumbledore, if you

 So in the final extremity, get outside the wards of Hogwarts and tear in

The boy wasn't awake, wasn't dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled and confused
 in the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unprotected by the safety
 rails that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors.
 In that shadowland his brain had woken up enough to think, but something
 else was too sleepy to act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained
 by his self-concept, his waking self's ideals of what he shouldn't think.
 That was the freedom of his brain's dreams, as his self-concept slept.

 the moral dilemma, he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangular
 horror of Azkaban, and whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that
 had ever been heard before on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across
 the sky and were heard on the other side of the world, and there was a
 blast of silver Patronus fire like a nuclear explosion that tore apart
 all the Dementors in an instant and ripped apart the metal walls of Azkaban,
 shattered the long corridors and all the dim orange lights, and then a
 moment later his brain remembered that there were people in there, and
 rewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the prisoners laughing as they
 flew away in flocks from the burning wreck of Azkaban, the silver light
 restoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started crying
 harder into his pillow, because he couldn't do it, because he wasn't God
