 last tip of the Sun was sinking below the horizon, the red light fading
 from the treetops, only the blue sky illuminating the six people standing
 upon the winter-dried and snow-spotted grass, near a vacant cage on whose
 floor lay an empty, tattered cloak.

Harry felt… well, 
\emph on
normal

 again.
 Sane-ish.
 The spell hadn't undone the day and its damage, hadn't made the injuries
 as if they had never been, but his hurts had been… bandaged, meliorated?
 It was hard to describe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was also looking healthier, though not fully restored.
 The old wizard's head turned for a moment, locked eyes with Professor Quirrell,
 then looked back to Harry.
 “Harry,” Dumbledore said, “are you about to collapse in exhaustion and
 possibly die?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No, strangely enough,” Harry said.
 “That took something out of me, but a lot less than I thought it would.”

 “Honestly, I expected my body to be hitting the ground with a thud about

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish sort of sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you for taking care of that, Quirinus,” said Dumbledore to Professor
 Quirrell, who was now standing above and behind the unconscious forms of
 the three Aurors.
 “I confess I am still feeling a bit peaky.
 Though I shall handle the Memory Charms myself.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell inclined his head, and then looked at Harry.
 “I will omit a good deal of useless incredulity,” said Professor Quirrell,
 “remarks to the effect that Merlin himself failed to do that, et cetera.
 Let us go straight to asking the important question.
 What the sweet slithering snakes was 
\emph on
that?

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The Patronus Charm,” Harry said.
 “Version 2.0.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I rejoice to see that you are your usual self again,” said Dumbledore.
 “But you are not going 
\emph on
anywhere
\emph default
, young Ravenclaw, until you tell me what exactly was that warm and happy
 thought.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hm…” said Harry.
 He tapped a contemplative finger on his cheek.
 “I wonder if I should?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please?” said the Headmaster.
 “Pretty please with sugar on top?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry felt an impulse and decided to go with it.
 It was dangerous, but there might not ever be a better opportunity until
 the end of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Three sodas,” Harry said to his pouch, then looked up at the Defense Professor
 and the Headmaster of Hogwarts.
 “Gentlemen,” Harry said, “I bought these sodas on my first visit to Platform
 Nine and Three-Quarters, on the day I entered into Hogwarts.
 I have been saving them for special occasions; there is a minor enchantment
 on them to ensure they are drunk at the right time.
 This is the last of my supply, but I do not think there will ever come
 a finer occasion.
 Shall we?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore took a soda can from Harry, and Harry tossed another to Professor
 Quirrell.
 The two older men each muttered identical charms over the can and frowned
 briefly at the result.
 Harry, for his part, simply popped the top and drank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor and the Headmaster of Hogwarts politely followed suit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry said, “I thought of my absolute rejection of death as the natural
 order.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might not be the right kind of warm feeling you needed to cast a Patronus
 Charm, but it was going into Harry's Top 10 nonetheless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The looks he got from the Defense Professor and the Headmaster briefly made
 Harry nervous, as the spilled Comed-Tea faded out of existence; but then
 the two of them each glanced at the other and both apparently decided that
 they couldn't get away with doing anything really awful to Harry in the
 other's presence.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Indeed,” said Dumbledore.
 “Explain.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry opened his mouth, and then, as realization hit him, rapidly snapped
 his mouth shut again.
 Godric hadn't told anyone, nor had Rowena if she'd known; there might have
 been any number of wizards who'd figured it out and kept their mouths shut.
 You couldn't forget if you 
\emph on
knew
\emph default
 that was what you were trying to do; once you realized

how

 it worked, the animal form of the Patronus Charm would never work for you

“Erm, sorry about this,” said Harry.
 “But I've just this instant realized that explaining would be an

 bad idea until you work some things out on your own.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Is that the truth, Harry?” Dumbledore said slowly.
 “Or are you just pretending to be wise

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But,” said the Headmaster.
 “But, but what am I to tell the Ministry? You can't just 
\emph on
lose
\emph default
 a Dementor!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Tell them I ate it,” said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry to choke on
 the soda he had unthinkingly raised to his lips.
 “I don't mind.

The two of them began to walk the dirt path back to Hogwarts, leaving behind
 Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly at the empty cage and the three sleeping
 Aurors awaiting their Memory Charms.

Aftermath, Harry Potter and Professor Quirrell:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked for a while before Professor Quirrell spoke, and all background
 noise dropped into silence when he did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You are exceptionally good at killing things, my student,” said Professor
 Quirrell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you,” Harry said sincerely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am not prying,” said Professor Quirrell, “but on the off-chance that
 it was 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 the Headmaster who you did not trust with the secret…?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry considered this.
 Professor Quirrell already couldn't cast the animal Patronus Charm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you couldn't untell a secret, and Harry was a fast enough learner to
 realize that he ought to at least 
\emph on
think
\emph default
 for a while before unleashing this one upon the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry shook his head, and Professor Quirrell nodded acceptance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Out of curiosity, Professor Quirrell,” said Harry, “if your bringing the
 Dementor to Hogwarts had been part of an evil plot, what would have been
 its goal?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Assassinate Dumbledore while he was weakened,” Professor Quirrell said
 without even hesitating.
 “Hm.
 The Headmaster told you he was suspicious of me?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry said nothing for a second while he tried to think of a reply, and
 then gave up when he realized he'd already answered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Interesting…” Professor Quirrell said.
 “Mr.

Potter, it is not out of the question that there 
\emph on
was

 a plot at work today.
 Your wand ending up that close to the Dementor's cage 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 have been an accident.
 Or one of the Aurors could have been Imperiused, Confunded, or Legilimized
 to exert an influence.
 Flitwick and myself should not be excluded as suspects, in your calculation.
 One notes that Professor Snape canceled all his classes today, and I suspect
 he is powerful enough to Disillusion himself; the Aurors cast detection
 charms early on, but they did not repeat them immediately before your turn.
 But most easily of all, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter, the deed could have been plotted by Dumbledore himself; and if he
 
\emph on
did
\emph default
, why, he might also take steps in advance to cast your suspicion elsewhere.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked on for a few steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But why 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 he?” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor stayed quiet a moment, and then said, “Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

Potter, what steps have you taken to investigate the Headmaster's character?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not many,” said Harry.
 He'd only recently realized… “Not nearly enough.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Then I will observe,” said Professor Quirrell, “that you do not find out
 all there is to know about a man by asking only his friends.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now it was Harry's turn to walk a few steps in silence on the slightly beaten
 dirt path that led back to Hogwarts.
 He'd really been supposed to know better than that already.
 Confirmation bias was the technical term; it meant, among other things,
 that when you chose your information sources, there was a notable tendency
 to choose information sources that agreed with your current opinions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you,” Harry said.
 “Actually… I didn't say it earlier, did I? Thank you for 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
.
 If another Dementor ever threatens you, or for that matter, slightly annoys
 you, just let me know and I'll introduce it to Mister Glowy Person.
 I don't like it when Dementors slightly annoy my friends.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That got him an indecipherable glance from Professor Quirrell.
 “You destroyed the Dementor because it threatened me?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Erm,” Harry said, “I'd sort of decided on it before then, but yes, that
 would have been sufficient reason by itself.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I see,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “And what would you have done about the threat to me if your spell 
\emph on
hadn't
\emph default
 worked for destroying the Dementor?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Plan B,” said Harry.
 “Encase the Dementor in dense metal with a high melting point, probably
 tungsten, drop it into an active volcano, and hope it ends up inside Earth's
 mantle.
 Ah, the whole planet is filled with molten lava under its surface

 “I really should have thought of that myself, all things considered.
 Tell me, Mr.

Potter, if you wanted to lose something where no one would ever find it
 again, where would you put it?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry considered this question.
 “I suppose I shouldn't ask

 you've found that needs losing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Quite,” said Professor Quirrell, as Harry had expected; and then, “Perhaps
 you will be told when you are older,” which Harry hadn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well,” said Harry, “besides trying to get it into the molten core of the
 planet, you could bury it in solid rock a kilometer underground in a randomly
 selected location

 maybe teleport it in, if there's some way to do that blindly, or drill
 a hole and repair the hole afterward; the important thing would be not
 to leave any traces leading there, so it's just an anonymous cubic meter
 somewhere in the Earth's crust.
 You could drop it into the Mariana Trench, that's the deepest depth of
 ocean on the planet 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

 or just pick some random other ocean trench, to make it less obvious.
 If you could make it buoyant and invisible, then you could throw it into
 the stratosphere.
 Or ideally you would launch it into space, with a cloak against detection,
 and a randomly fluctuating acceleration factor that would take it out of
 the Solar System.
 And afterward, of course, you'd Obliviate yourself, so even you didn't
 know exactly where it was.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Defense Professor was laughing, and it sounded even odder than his smile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Professor Quirrell?” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All excellent suggestions,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “But tell me, Mr.

Potter, why those exact five?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Huh?” said Harry.
 “They just seemed like the obvious sorts of ideas.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh?” said Professor Quirrell.
 “But there is an interesting pattern to them, you see.
 One might say it sounds like something of a riddle.
 I must admit, Mr.

Potter, that although it has had its ups and downs, on the whole, this has
 been a surprisingly good day.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And they continued walking down the path that led to the gates of Hogwarts,
 quite some distance apart; as Harry, without even thinking about it, automatica
lly stayed far enough away from the Defense Professor not to trigger that
 sense of doom, which for some reason seemed unusually strong right now.

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had refused to answer any questions, and as soon as they'd passed
 the split leading to the Slytherin dungeons, Daphne and Tracey had peeled
 off at once, walking as quickly as they could.
 Rumor traveled fast in Hogwarts, so they'd have to go to the dungeons right
 away if they wanted to be the first to tell everyone the story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Now remember,” said Daphne, “don't just blurt out about the kiss as soon
 as we walk in, okay? It works better if we tell the whole story in order.”
\end_layout

Tracey nodded excitedly.

And as soon as they burst into the Slytherin common room, Tracey Davis took
 a deep breath and shouted, “

There's no light in the place the Dementor takes you, Hermione.
 No warmth.
 No caring.
 It's somewhere that you can't even understand happiness.
 There's pain, and fear, and those can still drive you.
 You can hate, and take pleasure in destroying what you hate.
 You can laugh, when you see other people hurting.
 But you can't ever be happy, you can't even remember what it is that isn't
 there anymore… I don't think there's any way I can ever explain just what
 you saved me from.
 I'm usually ashamed to put people to trouble, I usually can't stand it
 when people make sacrifices for me, but this one time I'll say that no
 matter what it ends up costing you to have kissed me, don't ever doubt
 for a second that it was the right thing to do.

She felt frozen; she shouldn't have been so shocked, she shouldn't have
 found Harry so hard to face, but after what he'd been through… She had
 searched the young boy in front of her for any signs of Dementation, and
 failed to find them.
 But something about the calm with which he had asked such a foreboding
 question seemed deeply worrying.
 “Mr.

Potter, I can't possibly speak of such matters without the Headmaster's
 permission!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy in her office took this in without changing expression.
 “I would prefer not to disturb the Headmaster over this matter,” Harry
 Potter said calmly.
 “I 
\emph on
insist
\emph default
 on not disturbing him, in fact, and you did promise that our conversation
 would be kept private.
 So let me put it this way.
 I know that there was, in fact, a prophecy.
 I know that you are the one who originally heard it from Professor Trelawney.
 I know that the prophecy identified the child of James and Lily as someone
 dangerous to the Dark Lord.
 And I know who I am, indeed everyone now knows who I am, so you are revealing
 nothing new or dangerous, if you tell me only this: What was the 
\emph on
exact wording
\emph default
 which identified 
\emph on
me,
\emph default
 the child of James and Lily?”
\end_layout

Trelawney's hollow voice echoed in her mind

“Harry,” said Professor McGonagall, “I can't possibly tell you that!” It

The boy looked at her with strange, sorrowful eyes.
 “Can you not sneeze without the Headmaster's permission, Professor McGonagall?
 For I do promise to you that I have good reason to ask, and good reason
 to keep the question private.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Please don't, Harry,” she whispered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right,” Harry said.
 “One simple question.
 Please.
 Was the Potter family mentioned by 
\emph on
name?
\emph default
 Does the prophecy literally say `Potter'?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She stared at Harry for a while.
 She couldn't have said why or where she got the sense that this was a critical
 point, that she could not lightly refuse the request, nor lightly accede
 to it

“No,” she finally said.
 “Please, Harry, don't ask any more.”

The boy smiled, a little sadly it seemed, and said, “Thank you, Minerva.
 You are a good woman and true.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And while her mouth was still open in utter shock, Harry Potter got up and
 left the office; and only then did she realize that Harry had taken her
 refusal as an answer, and the true answer at that

\begin_layout Standard
Harry closed the door behind himself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The logic had presented itself with a strange diamondlike clarity.
 Harry couldn't have said if it had come to him during Fawkes's singing,
 or maybe even before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lord Voldemort had killed James Potter.
 He had preferred to spare Lily Potter's life.
 He had continued his attack, therefore, with the sole purpose of killing
 their infant child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dark Lords were not usually scared of infant children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there was a prophecy about Harry Potter being dangerous to Lord Voldemort,
 and Lord Voldemort had known that prophecy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“I give you this rare chance to flee.
 But I will not trouble myself to subdue you, and your death here will not
 save your child.
 Step aside, foolish woman, if you have any sense in you at all!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Had it been a whim, to give her that chance? But then Lord Voldemort would
 not have tried to persuade her.
 Had the prophecy warned Lord Voldemort against killing Lily Potter? Then
 Lord Voldemort 
\emph on
would
\emph default
 have troubled himself to subdue her.
 Lord Voldemort had been 
\emph on
mildly
\emph default
 inclined not to kill Lily Potter.
 The preference had been stronger than a whim, but not as strong as a warning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So suppose that someone whom Lord Voldemort considered a lesser ally or
 servant, useful but not indispensable, had begged the Dark Lord to spare
 Lily's life.
 Lily's, but not James's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This person had known that Lord Voldemort would attack the house of the
 Potters.
 Had known both the prophecy, and the fact that the Dark Lord knew it.
 Otherwise he would not have begged Lily's life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Professor McGonagall, besides herself, the other two who knew
 of the prophecy were Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Severus Snape, who had loved Lily before she was Lily Potter, and hated
 James.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Severus, then, had learned of the prophecy, and told it to the Dark Lord.
 Which he had done because the prophecy had not described the Potters by
 name.
 It had been a riddle, and Severus had solved that riddle only too late.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if Severus had been the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 to hear the prophecy, and disposed to tell it to the Dark Lord, then why
 would he also have told Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore Dumbledore or Professor McGonagall had heard it first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Headmaster of Hogwarts had no obvious reason to tell the Transfiguration
 Professor about an extremely sensitive and crucial prophecy.
 But the Transfiguration Professor had every reason to tell the Headmaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seemed likely, then, that Professor McGonagall had been the first to
 hear it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prior probabilities said that it had been Professor Trelawney, Hogwarts's
 resident seer.
 Seers were rare, so if you counted up most of the seconds Professor McGonagall
 had spent in the presence of a seer over the course of her lifetime, most
 of those seer-seconds would be Trelawney-seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall had told Dumbledore, and would have told no one else
 about the prophecy without permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it was Albus Dumbledore who had arranged for Severus Snape to
 somehow learn of the prophecy.
 And Dumbledore himself had solved the riddle successfully, or he would
 not have selected 
\emph on
Severus
\emph default
, who had once loved Lily, as the intermediary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore had deliberately arranged for Lord Voldemort to hear about the
 prophecy, in hopes of luring him to his death.
 Perhaps Dumbledore had arranged for Severus to learn only 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of the prophecy, or there were other prophecies of which Severus had remained
 innocent… somehow Dumbledore had known that an 
\emph on
immediate
\emph default
 attack on the Potters would still lead to Lord Voldemort's 
\emph on
immediate
\emph default
 defeat, although Lord Voldemort himself had not believed this.
 Or maybe that had just been a lucky stroke of Dumbledore's insanity, his
 taste for bizarre plots…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Severus had ended up serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps the Death Eaters
 would not look kindly on Severus if Dumbledore revealed his role in their
 defeat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore had tried to arrange for Harry's mother to be spared.
 But that part of his plot had failed.
 And he had knowingly condemned James Potter to his death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dumbledore was responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents.
 
\emph on
If
\emph default
 the whole chain of logic was correct.
 Harry could not, in justice, say that successfully ending the Wizarding
 War did not count as extenuating circumstances.
 But somehow this still… 
\emph on
bothered him a great deal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And it was time and past time to ask Draco Malfoy what the 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 side of that war had to say about the character of Albus Percival Wulfric
 Brian Dumbledore.
