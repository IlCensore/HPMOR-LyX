 old wizard sat alone at his desk, in the unsilence of the Headmaster's
 office, amid the innumerable and unnoticed devices; his robes a gentle
 yellow, of soft fabric, not such clothing as he ordinarily wore before
 others.
 His wrinkled hand held a quill scratching away at an official-looking parchment.
 If you had somehow been there to watch his lined face, you would have been
 unable to deduce anything more about the man himself than you understood
 of the enigmatic devices.
 You might have observed that the face looked a little sad, a little tired,
 but then Albus Dumbledore always looked like that when he was alone.

\begin_layout Standard
In the Floo hearth there were only scattered ashes without a hint of flame,
 a magical door that had been shut so solidly as to stop existing.
 On the material plane, the great oaken door to the office had been closed
 and locked; beyond that door, the Endless Stairs stayed motionless; at
 the bottom of those stairs, the gargoyles that blocked the entrance did
 not flow, their pseudo-life withdrawn to leave solid rock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, even as the quill was in the middle of penning a word, even as it
 was in the middle of scratching a letter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard shot to his feet with a speed that would have shocked anyone
 watching, abandoning the quill in mid-letter to fall onto the parchment;
 like lightning he spun on the oaken door, his yellow robes whirling around
 him and a wand of dread power leaping into his hand 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And as abruptly, the old wizard paused, halting his motion even as the wand
 came to bear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hand struck upon the oaken door, three times knocking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More slowly, now, that grim wand went back into the dueling holster strapped
 beneath the old wizard's sleeve.
 The ancient man moved forward a few paces, drew himself up into a more
 formal stance, composed his face.
 Nearby upon the desk, the quill moved to the side of the parchment, as
 though it had been carefully placed there rather than dropped in haste;
 and the parchment itself flipped over to show blankness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a silent twitch of his will, the oaken door swung open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hard as stones, the green eyes glared at him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I admit that I am impressed, Harry,” the old wizard said quietly.
 “The Cloak of Invisibility would have let you evade my lesser means of
 vision; but I did not sense my golems step aside, nor the stairs turning.
 How did you come here?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy walked into the office, step by deliberate step until the door closed
 smoothly behind him.
 “I can go anywhere I choose, with or without permission,” that boy said.
 His voice seemed calm; too calm, perhaps.
 “I am in your office because I decided to be here, and to hell with passwords.
 You are greatly mistaken, Headmaster Dumbledore, if you think that I stay
 in this school because I am a prisoner here.
 I simply have not chosen,
\emph on
 yet
\emph default
, to leave.
 Now keeping that in mind, why did you command your agent, Professor Snape,
 to break the agreement we made in this office, that he would not torment
 any student in her fourth year or below?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard looked at the angry young hero for a long moment.
 Then, slowly enough not to alarm the boy, those wizened fingers drew open
 one of the manifold drawers of the desk, lifted out a sheet of parchment,
 laid it upon the desk.
 “Fourteen,” the old wizard said.
 “It is not the number of all the owls sent last night.
 Only the owls sent to families with a seat on the Wizengamot, or families
 of great wealth, or families already allied with your foes.
 Or, in the case of Robert Jugson, all three; for his father, Lord Jugson,
 is a Death Eater, and his grandfather a Death Eater who died by Alastor
 Moody's wand.
 What the letters said, I do not know, but I can guess.
 Do you 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 not understand, Harry Potter? Each time Hermione Granger 
\emph on
won
\emph default
, as you put it, the danger to her from Slytherin grew again, and yet again.
 But now the Slytherins have triumphed over her, easily and safely, without
 violence or lasting harm.
 They have won, and need fight no more…” The old wizard sighed.
 “So I had planned.
 So I had hoped.
 So it would have been, if the Defense Professor had not taken it upon himself
 to intervene.
 Now the dispute goes to the Board of Governors, where Severus will seem
 to conquer the Defense Professor; but that will not feel the same to the
 Slytherins, it will not have been over and finished in a moment, to their
 satisfaction.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy advanced further into the room, his head tilting back further to
 look up at the half-moon glasses; and somehow it was like the boy was looking
 down at the Headmaster, rather than up.
 “So this Lord Jugson is a Death Eater?” the boy said softly.
 “Good.
 His life is already bought and paid for, then, and I can do anything I
 want to him without ethical problems 
\begin_inset ERT

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Harry!
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy's voice was clear as ice, frozen of purest water from some untouched
 spring.
 “You seem to think that the Light should live in fear of the darkness.
 I say it should be the other way around.
 I'd prefer not to kill this Lord Jugson, even if he is a Death Eater.
 But one hour of brainstorming with the Defense Professor would be plenty
 of time to come up with some creative way to wreck him financially, or
 get him exiled from magical Britain.
 That would serve to make the point, I think.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I confess,” the old wizard said slowly, “that the thought of ruining a
 five-hundred-year-old House, and challenging a Death Eater to war to the
 finish, over a scuffle in a Hogwarts hallway, had not occurred to me, Harry.”
 The old wizard lifted a finger to push back his half-moon glasses from
 where they had slid a little down his nose, during his sudden motion earlier.
 “I daresay it would not occur to Miss Granger either, nor to Professor
 McGonagall, nor to Fred and George.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy shrugged.
 “It wouldn't 
\emph on
be
\emph default
 about the hallways,” the boy said.
 “It would be justice for his past crimes, and I'd only do it if Jugson
 made the first move.
 The point isn't to make people scared of me as a wild card, after all.
 It's to teach them that neutrals are perfectly safe from me, and poking
 me with a stick is incredibly dangerous.” The boy smiled in a way that didn't
 reach his eyes.
 “Maybe I'll buy an ad in the Daily Prophet, saying that anyone who wants
 to carry on this dispute with me will learn the true meaning of Chaos,
 but anyone who leaves me alone will be fine.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
No
\emph default
,” the old wizard said.
 His voice was deeper now, showing something of his true age and power.
 “No, Harry, that must not be.
 You have not yet learned the meaning of fighting, what truly happens when
 foes meet in battle.
 And so you dream, as young boys do, of teaching your foes to fear you.
 It frightens me that you, at far too young an age, might already have enough
 power to make some part of your dreams into reality.
 There is 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 turning of that road which does not lead into darkness, Harry, none.
 That is the way of a Dark Lord, for certain.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy hesitated, then, and his eyes flickered to the empty golden platform
 where Fawkes sometimes rested his wings.
 It was a gesture that few would have caught, but the old wizard knew it
 very well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“All right, forget the part about teaching them to fear me,” the boy said
 then.
 His voice was no less hard, but some of the cold had gone from it.
 “I still don't think you should let children get hurt out of fear of what
 someone like Lord Jugson 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 do.
 Protecting them is the whole point of your job.
 If Lord Jugson really does try to get in your way, then do whatever it
 takes to stop him.
 Give me full access to my vaults, and 
\emph on
I'll
\emph default
 take personal responsibility for dealing with any fallout from banning
 bullies in Hogwarts, whether it's Lord Jugson or anyone else.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly the old wizard shook his head.
 “You seem to think, Harry, that I need merely use my full power, and all
 foes will be swept aside.
 You are wrong.
 Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, through the 
\emph on
Daily Prophet
\emph default
 he sways all Britain, only by bare margins does he not control enough of
 the Board of Governors to oust me from Hogwarts.
 Amelia Bones and Bartemius Crouch are allies, but even they would step
 aside if they saw us acting wantonly.
 The world that surrounds you is more fragile than you seem to believe,
 and we must walk with greater care.
 The old Wizarding War never ended, Harry, it only continued in a different
 form; the black king slept, and Lucius Malfoy moved his chesspieces for
 a time.
 Do you think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit you to take a pawn of his
 color?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy smiled, now with a touch of coldness again.
 “Okay, I'll figure out some way to set it up so that it looks like Lord
 Jugson betrayed his own side.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry

\begin_layout Standard
“Obstacles mean you

 It doesn't mean you abandon the children you're supposed to protect.
 Let the Light win, and if trouble comes of it

” The boy shrugged.
 “Let Light win again.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So might phoenixes speak, if they had words,” the old wizard said.
 “But you do not understand the 
\emph on
phoenix's price.
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last two words were spoken in a peculiarly clear voice that seemed to
 echo around the office, and then a huge rumbling noise seemed to come from
 all around them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the ancient shield on the wall and the Sorting Hat's hatrack, the
 stone of the walls began to flow and move, pouring itself into two framing
 columns and revealing a gap between them, an opening that showed a set
 of stone stairs leading upward into darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard turned and strode toward those stairs, and then looked back
 at where Harry Potter stood.
 “Come!” said the old wizard.
 There was no twinkle now in those blue eyes.
 “Since you have already gone so far as to force your way here uninvited,
 you may as well go further.”

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were no railings on those stone steps, and after the first few steps
 Harry drew his wand and cast 
\emph on
Lumos.

\emph default
 The Headmaster did not look back, did not seem to be looking downward,
 as though he had climbed the steps often enough to have no need of vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy knew that he should have been curious, or frightened, but there
 was no spare brain capacity for that.
 It was taking all his control not to let the fury simmering inside him
 boil over any further than it already had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stairs went on for only a short distance, one straight rising flight
 without turns or curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the top was a door of solid metal, looking black in the blue light cast
 from Harry's wand, meaning that the metal itself was either black or perhaps
 red.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albus Dumbledore lifted up his long wand like a brandished symbol, and again
 spoke in that strange voice which seemed to echo in Harry's ears, as though
 burning itself into his memory: “
\emph on
Phoenix's fate.
\emph default
”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That last door opened, and Harry followed Dumbledore inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The room beyond seemed to be made of black metal like the door that led
 to it.
 The walls were black, the floor was black.
 The ceiling above was black, but for a single globe of crystal that hung
 down from the ceiling on a white chain, and shone with a brilliant silver
 light that looked like it had been cast in imitation of Patronus light,
 though you could tell it wasn't the real thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the room were pedestals of black metal, each bearing a moving picture,
 or an upright cylinder half-filled with some faintly shining silver liquid,
 or a lone small object; a scorched silver necklace, a crushed hat, an untouched
 golden wedding ring.
 Many pedestals bore all three, the moving picture and the silver liquid
 and the item.
 There seemed to be a good many wizards' wands upon those pedestals, and
 many of those wands were broken, or burned, or looked like the wood had
 somehow melted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took that long for Harry to realize what he was seeing, and then his
 throat suddenly choked; it was like the rage inside him had been hit a
 hammerblow, maybe the hardest hammerblow of his entire existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“These are not all the fallen of all my wars,” Albus Dumbledore said.
 His back was to Harry, only his grey locks and yellowish robes showed.
 “Not even nearly all of them.
 Only my closest friends, and those who died of my worst decisions, there
 is something of them here.
 Those I regret most of all, this is their place.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry couldn't count how many pedestals were in the room.
 It might have been around a hundred.
 The room of black metal was not small, and there was clearly more space
 left in it for future pedestals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Albus Dumbledore turned and regarded Harry, the deep blue eyes set like
 steel in his brow, but his voice, when he spoke, was calm.
 “It seems to me that you know nothing of the phoenix's price,” Albus Dumbledore
 said quietly.
 “It seems to me that you are not an evil person, but most terribly ignorant,
 and confident in your ignorance; as I once was, a long time ago.
 Yet I have never heard Fawkes so clearly as you seemed to, that day.
 Perhaps I was already too old and full of grief, when my phoenix came to
 me.
 If there is something I do not understand, about how ready I should be
 to fight, then tell me of this wisdom.” There was no anger in the old wizard's
 voice; the impact that drove out your breath like falling off a broomstick
 was all in the scorched and shattered wands, gleaming gently in their death
 beneath the silver light.
 “Or else turn and go from this place, but then I wish to hear no more of
 it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't know what to say.
 There had been nothing in his own life that was like this, and all the
 words seemed to fall away.
 He would find something to say if he looked, but he couldn't believe, in
 that moment, that the words would be meaningful.
 You shouldn't be able to win any possible argument, just from people having
 died of your decisions, and yet even knowing that it felt like there was
 nothing to be said.
 That there was nothing Harry had any right to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry almost did turn and go from that place, except for the understanding
 which came to him then: that there was probably a part of Albus Dumbledore
 which always stood in this place, always, no matter where he was.
 And that if you stood in a place like this you could do anything, 
\emph on
lose
\emph default
 anything, if it meant that you didn't have to fight another time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the pedestals caught Harry's eye; the photograph on it did not move,
 did not smile or wave, it was a Muggle photograph of a woman looking seriously
 at the camera, her brown hair twisted into braids of an ordinary Muggle
 style that Harry hadn't seen on any witch.
 There was a cylinder of silvery liquid beside the photograph, but no object;
 no melted ring or broken wand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry walked forward, slowly, until he stood before the pedestal.
 “Who was she?” Harry said, his voice sounding strange in his own ears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Her name was Tricia Glasswell,” said Dumbledore.
 “The mother of a Muggleborn daughter, who the Death Eaters killed.
 She was a detective of the Muggle government, and after that she fed informatio
n from the Muggle authorities to the Order of the Phoenix, until she was

 into the hands of Voldemort.” There was a catch in the old wizard's voice.
 “She did not die well, Harry.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Did she save lives?” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes,” the wizard said quietly.
 “She did.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry lifted his gaze from the pedestal to look at Dumbledore.
 “Would the world be a better place if she hadn't fought?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No, it would not,” said the old wizard.
 His voice was tired, and grieving.
 He seemed more bent now, as though he were folding in on himself.
 “I see that you still do not understand.
 I think you will not understand until the day that you

 it is an ill thing, and its nature is corrupted, as terrible as the darkest
 rituals.
 Violence, once begun, becomes like a Lethifold that strikes at any life
 near it.
 I… would spare you that lesson the way I learned it, Harry.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked away from the blue eyes, cast his gaze down at the black metal
 of the floor.
 The Headmaster was trying to tell him something important, that was clear;
 and it wasn't something that Harry thought was stupid, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There was a Muggle once named Mohandas Gandhi,” Harry said to the floor.
 “He thought the government of Muggle Britain shouldn't rule over his country.
 And he refused to fight.
 He convinced his whole country not to fight.
 Instead he told his people to walk up to the British soldiers and let themselve
s be struck down, without resisting, and when Britain couldn't stand doing
 that any more, we freed his country.
 I thought it was a very beautiful thing, when I read about it, I thought
 it was something higher than all the wars that anyone had ever fought with
 guns or swords.
 That they'd really done that, and that it had 
\emph on
actually worked.
\emph default
” Harry drew another breath.
 “Only then I found out that Gandhi told his people, during World War II,
 that if the Nazis invaded they should use nonviolent resistance against
 them, too.
 But the Nazis would've just shot everyone in sight.
 And maybe Winston Churchill always felt that there should've been a better
 way, some clever way to win without having to hurt anyone; but he never
 found it, and so he had to fight.” Harry looked up at the Headmaster, who
 was staring at him.
 “Winston Churchill was the one who tried to convince the British government
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 to give Czechoslovakia to Hitler in exchange for a peace treaty, that they
 should fight right away

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I recognize the name, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
 The old wizard's lips twitched upward.
 “Although honesty compels me to say that dear Winston was never one for
 pangs of conscience, even after a dozen shots of Firewhiskey.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The point is,” Harry said, after a brief pause to remember exactly who
 he was talking to, and fight down the suddenly returning sense that he
 was an ignorant child gone insane with audacity who had no right to be
 in this room and no right to question Albus Dumbledore about anything,
 “the point is, saying violence is evil isn't an 
\emph on
answer.

\emph default
 It doesn't say when to fight and when not to fight.
 It's a hard question and Gandhi refused to deal with it, and that's why
 I lost some of my respect for him.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And your own answer, Harry?” Dumbledore said quietly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“One answer is that you shouldn't ever use violence except to stop violence,”
 Harry said.
 “You shouldn't risk anyone's life except to save even more lives.
 It 
\emph on
sounds
\emph default
 good when you say it like that.
 Only the problem is that if a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house,
 the police officer 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 try to stop the burglar, even though the burglar might fight back and someone
 might get hurt or even killed.
 Even if the burglar is only trying to steal jewelry, which is just a

“

 “And yet it will come.
 Voldemort is returning.
 The black chesspieces are gathering.
 Severus is one of the most important pieces our own side possesses, in
 that war.
 But our evil Potions Master must, as the saying goes, keep up appearances.
 If Severus can pay that keep by hurting the feelings of children, only
 their feelings, Harry,” the old wizard's voice was very soft, “you would
 have to be most terribly innocent in the ways of war, to think he had made
 a poor bargain.

 They look

 He simply stood where he was, among the pedestals.

\begin_layout Standard
“You shouldn't be Headmaster,” Harry said through the burning in his throat.
 “I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't try to be a school principal
 and run a war at the same time.
 Hogwarts shouldn't be part of this.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The children will survive,” the old wizard said with tired old eyes.
 “They would not survive Voldemort.
 Have you wondered why the children of Hogwarts do not speak much of their
 parents, Harry? It is because there is always, within earshot, someone
 who has lost their mother or father or both.
 That is what Voldemort left behind, the last time he came.
 
\emph on
Nothing

 is worth that war beginning again even one day earlier than it must, or
 lasting one day longer than it must.” The old wizard did gesture now, as
 though to indicate all the shattered wands.
 “We did not fight because it seemed righteous to do so! We fought when
 we had to, when there was no other way left.
 That was our answer.”

“Who have you been talking to, Harry?” said the old wizard.
 “No, do not answer.
 I already know.” Dumbledore sighed.
 “Many have asked me that question, and always I have turned them aside.

 Will you swear never to speak of it to another, until I give you leave?”

“Grindelwald possessed an ancient and terrible device,” said Dumbledore.
 “While he held it, I could not break his defense.
 In our duel I could not win, only fight him for long hours until he fell
 in exhaustion; and I would have died of it afterward, if not for Fawkes.
 But while his Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice to sustain him, Grindelwal
d would 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 have fallen.
 He was, during that time, truly invincible.
 Of that grim device which Grindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect,
 there must be not a single hint.
 And therefore you must not speak of it, and I will say no more for now.
 That is all, Harry.
 There is no moral to it, and no wisdom.
 That is all there is.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry slowly nodded.
 It wasn't entirely implausible, by the standards of magic…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And then,” Dumbledore's voice went on, even quieter, almost as though he
 were speaking to himself, “since it was I who felled him, they obeyed me
 when I said he should not die, though they cried by the thousands for his
 blood.
 So he was imprisoned in Nurmengard, in the prison that he built, and he
 abides there until this day.
 I went to that duel without any intent to kill him, Harry.
 Because, you see, I had tried to kill Grindelwald once before, a long time
 ago, and that… that was… it proved to be… a mistake, Harry…” The old wizard
 was staring now at his long dark-grey wand where he held it in both hands,
 as though it were a crystal ball out of Muggle fantasy, a scrying pool
 within which answers could be found.
 “And I thought, then… I thought that I should never kill.
 And then came Voldemort.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard looked back up at Harry, and said, in a hoarse voice, “He
 is not like Grindelwald, Harry.
 There is nothing human left in him.
 
\emph on
Him
\emph default
 you must destroy.
 You must not hesitate, when the time comes.
 To him alone, of all the creatures in this world, you must show no mercy;

 Save your fury for that, and that alone.”

The old wizard stared at the young boy, who had straightened, and his face
 changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“In other words,” the boy said, as though talking to himself without any

“Harry…?”

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” the boy said.
 The boy looked up, and his eyes were blazing like green fire.
 “I do not accept your answer, Headmaster.
 Fawkes gave me a mission, and I know now why Fawkes gave that mission to
 me, and not to you.
 You are willing to accept balances of power where the bad guys end up winning.
 I am not.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That too is not an answer,” the old wizard said; his face showed nothing
 of his hurt, he had long practice in concealing pain.
 “Refusing to accept something does not change it.
 I wonder now if you are simply too young to understand this matter, Harry,
 despite your outward airs; only in children's fantasies can all battles
 be won, and not a single evil tolerated.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And that's why I can destroy Dementors and you can't,” said the boy.
 “Because I believe that the darkness can be broken.”
\end_layout

The old wizard's breath stopped in his throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The phoenix's price isn't inevitable,” the boy said.
 “It's not part of some deep balance built into the universe.
 It's just the parts of the problem where you haven't figured out yet how

“And the true fight, the fight against Voldemort?” the old wizard said in

 “What will you do to win

 you are not yet beyond prices, and perhaps you never will be! For you to

“I asked Professor Quirrell why he'd laughed,” the boy said evenly, “after
 he awarded Hermione those hundred points.
 And Professor Quirrell said, these aren't his exact words, but it's pretty
 much what he said, that he'd found it tremendously amusing that the great
 and good Albus Dumbledore had been sitting there doing nothing as this
 poor innocent girl begged for help, while
\emph on
 he
\emph default
 had been the one to defend her.
 And he told me then that by the time good and moral people were done tying
 themselves up in knots, what they usually did was nothing; or, if they
 did act, you could hardly tell them apart from the people called bad.
 Whereas 
\emph on
he
\emph default
 could help innocent girls any time he felt like it, because he wasn't a
 good person.
 And that I ought to remember that, any time I considered growing up to
 be good.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The old wizard did not show the force of the blow.
 Only a slight widening of his eyes would have betrayed it, if you had been
 watching him very closely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Don't worry, Headmaster,” said the boy.
 “I haven't gotten my wires crossed.
 I know that I'm supposed to learn goodness from Hermione and Fawkes, not
 from Professor Quirrell and you.
 Which brings me to the actual reason why I came here.
 Hermione's time is too valuable to waste in detentions.
 Professor Snape will revoke it, claiming that I blackmailed him.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a hesitation the old wizard nodded his head, the silver beard swaying
 slowly beneath.
 “That would not be best for
\emph on
 her,
\emph default
 Harry,” the old wizard said.
 “But the detention can be put down as being served with Professor Binns,
 and you and she can study together in his classroom.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Fine,” the boy said.
 “I think that was all the business we had together, in the end.
 You may expect, the next time you seem to be working on the side of the
 bad guys or letting them win, that I will do whatever I think Fawkes would
 tell me to, regardless of how much trouble comes of it.
 I hope we're both clear on that.”
\end_layout

Without another word, the boy turned and walked out of the room, through
 the open door of black metal, the words “

(Some time later, an earlier version of Harry, who had invisibly waited

In a shadowy clearing the Defense Professor waited, his back leaned negligently
 against the rough grey bark of a towering beech tree as yet unleaved in
 the late March days, so that its trunk and crown seemed like a pale arm
 reaching up from the ground and exploding into a hand of a thousand fingers.
 Around the Defense Professor and above him were branches so dense that
 even in the earliest spring, with few trees so much as budding, you could
 have hardly seen the sky from the ground.
 The strands of the wooden net crossed and proliferated so many times that
 if you were on a broomstick above, searching for someone below, you would
 have found it easier to follow your ears than your eyes.
 Nor would it have helped that it was almost dark amid the prohibited woods,
 the unseen sun almost set, so that only a few glows of fading sunlight
 illuminated the tops of the tallest trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then came the faintest sound of footsteps, almost inaudible even on the
 forest ground; the gait of a man accustomed to passing unseen.
 No twig snapped, nor leaf rustled

A figure clad in a black cloak shimmered into existence, his head turning
 to look left and then right.
 In the figure's right hand, gripped low, was a wand of wood so grey it

“I do not know why you wished to meet

“Oh,” Professor Quirrell said idly, as though the whole matter was of the
 least importance, “I thought you would prefer privacy.
 The walls of Hogwarts have ears, and you would not wish the Headmaster
 to know of your role in yesterday's affair, would you?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The March chill seemed to grow deeper, the temperature further fall.
 “I don't know what you're talking about,” the Potions Master said icily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You know perfectly well what we're talking about,” said Professor Quirrell
 in an amused voice.
 “Really, my good Professor, you should not meddle in the affairs of idiots
 unless you are ready to defend yourself upon the instant from all their
 violence.” (The Defense Professor's hands still lay relaxed and open at
 his side.) “And yet none of those idiots seem to remember the sight of you
 falling, nor do the young ladies recall your presence.
 Which raises the fascinating question of why you would go to the extraordinary
 length, I dare say the 
\emph on
desperate
\emph default
 length, of casting
\emph on
 fifty-two
\emph default
 Memory Charms.” Professor Quirrell tilted his head.
 “Would you fear so much the opinions of mere students? I think not.
 Would you dread the matter becoming known to your good friend, Lord Malfoy?
 But those fools, upon the very spot, invented a quite satisfactory excuse
 for your presence.
 No, there is only one person who holds so much power over you, and who
 would be most perturbed to find you executing any plot without his knowledge.
 Your true and hidden master, Albus Dumbledore.”

“

\begin_layout Standard
“But now, it seems, you are moving on your own; and so I find myself most
 intrigued as to what you could

 of the Potions Master with the scrutiny a man might give an exceptionally
 interesting bug, even if it was still ultimately just a bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am no servant of Dumbledore's,” the Potions Master said coldly.

\begin_layout Standard
“Really? What astonishing news.” The Defense Professor smiled slightly.
 “Do tell me all about it.”

There was a long pause.
 From some tree an owl hooted, the sound huge in the silence; neither man
 startled or flinched.

“You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” Severus Snape said, his voice
 very soft.

\begin_layout Standard
“I don't?” said Professor Quirrell.
 “How would you know?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“On the other hand,” the Potions Master continued, voice still soft, “my

\begin_layout Standard
The man leaning against the grey bark raised his eyebrows.
 “Such as?”

 “Things you might not think I knew.”

“You know nothing of the sort.” The man's back straightened against the wood.
 “Do not bluff against me, Severus Snape; I find it annoying, and you are
 in no position to annoy me.
 A single glance would tell any competent wizard that the Headmaster has
 laced that corridor with a ridiculous quantity of wards and webs, triggers
 and tripsigns.
 And more: there are Charms laid there of ancient power, magical constructs
 of which I have heard not even rumors, techniques that must have been disgorged
 from the hoarded lore of Flamel himself.
 Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would have had trouble passing those without

 “And for the actual lock, a

 out Miss Granger on the day she entered Hogwarts.
 Never before in my existence have I encountered such a blatant trap.” Now

“Yes, I am.” Professor Quirrell leaned back against the grey wood again,
 his eyes drifting up to the dense net of branches, the falling night scarcely
 visible between the complex crossings.
 “I simply wished to learn whether you would call me on it, since you are
 pretending to know so little.” The Defense Professor smiled to himself.

“Yeah, right,” said Draco sarcastically, without the slightest hesitation
 or delay, looking back down at his Astronomy homework like he wasn't the
 least bit nervous.
 It was all happening the way Draco had feared it would, but at least that
 meant he'd played this conversation in his head over and over, coming up
 with the right opening gambit.
 “Come on, Gregory, you've dueled General Granger, you 
\emph on

\emph default
 how strong her spells are.
 Like a real Muggle-spawn is going to be more powerful than you, more powerful

A slow pulse of silence through Draco's bedroom.

Draco could hear the words in his head; they sounded in Father's voice,
 with the same sternness.
 It was the sort of thing Father had

 told
\emph default
 him to say, if Vincent or Gregory ever questioned him; and if that didn't
 work he was to hex them.
 They were

 Draco was in charge, they were his servants, and if Draco couldn't keep
 it that way then he wasn't fit to inherit House Malfoy…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It's all right, Gregory,” Draco said, as gently as he could.
 “All you've got to do is worry about protecting me.
 Nobody's going to blame you for following my orders, not my father, not
 yours.” Putting all the warmth he could into his voice, like trying to cast
 a Patronus Charm.
 “And anyway, the next war isn't going to be the same as the last one.
 House Malfoy was around long before the Dark Lord, and not every Lord Malfoy
 does the same thing.
 Father knows that.”

“Does he?” said Gregory in trembling voice.
 “Does he

Draco nodded.
 “Professor Quirrell knows it too,” said Draco.
 “That's what the armies are about.
 The Defense Professor's right, when the next war comes, Father won't be
 able to unite the whole country, they'll remember the

 war.
 But anyone who's fought in Professor Quirrell's armies will remember who
 the strongest generals were, they'll know who's worthy to lead them.
 They'll proclaim Harry Potter their Lord, and I'll be his right hand, and
 House Malfoy will come out on top, like always.
 People might even turn to

me,

 That's what I'm setting up now.

Gregory reached up and wiped his eyes, looking down again at his Transfiguration

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being invisible should've been more 
\emph on
interesting
\emph default
 than this, the corridors of Hogwarts should have been outlined in strange
 colors or something.
 But actually, Hermione thought, being under Harry's invisibility cloak
 was exactly like 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 being under an invisibility cloak, except for the cloak part.
 When you pulled the veil of soft black cloth down from the hood and over
 your face, you couldn't even see it stretching in front of you, and afterward
 it didn't seem to impede your breathing.
 And the world looked just the same, except that when you walked past things
 of metal, you didn't see any small reflections of yourself.
 Portraits never looked at you, only did whatever strange things they did
 when they were alone.
 Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she 
\emph on
wanted
\emph default
 to.
 Most of all, there was no
\emph on
 you
\emph default
 anymore as you walked around, no hands, no feet, just a changing point
 of view.
 It was an unnerving feeling, not so much of being 
\emph on
invisible
\emph default
 as of 
\emph on
not existing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry hadn't questioned her at all, she'd just got out the word `invisibility'
 and then Harry was drawing his invisibility cloak from his pouch.
 She hadn't even been given a chance to explain about her extremely secret
 meeting with Daphne and Millicent Bulstrode, or that she thought it would
 help protect the other girls, Harry had just handed over what was probably
 a Deathly Hallow.
 If you were fair, and she 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 try to be fair, she had to admit that sometimes Harry could be a very true,
 true friend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The secret meeting itself had been a great big failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Millicent had claimed to be a seer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had carefully explained to Millicent and Daphne at considerable
 length that this could not possibly be true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She and Harry had looked up Divination early on in their research; Harry
 had insisted that they read everything they could find about prophecies
 that wasn't in the Restricted Section.
 As Harry had observed, it would save a lot of effort if they could just
 get a seer to prophesy everything they would figure out thirty-five years
 later.
 (Or to put it in Harry's terms, any means of obtaining information transmitted
 from the distant future was potentially an instant global victory condition.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, as Hermione had explained to Millicent, prophesying wasn't controllable,
 there was no way to 
\emph on
ask
\emph default
 for a prophecy about anything in particular.
 Instead (the books had said) there was a sort of 
\emph on
pressure
\emph default
 that built up in Time, when some huge event was trying to happen, or stop
 itself from happening.
 And seers were like weak points that let out the pressure, when the right
 listener was nearby.
 So prophecies were only about big, important things, because only that
 generated enough pressure; and you almost never got more than one seer
 saying the same thing, because afterward the pressure was gone.
 And, as Hermione had further explained to Millicent, the seers themselves
 didn't remember their prophecies, because the message wasn't for
\emph on
 them
\emph default
.
 And the messages would come out in riddles, and only someone who heard
 the prophecy in the seer's original voice would hear all the meaning that
 was in the riddle.
 There was no
\emph on
 possible
\emph default
 way that Millicent could just give out a prophecy
\emph on
 any time she wanted
\emph default
, about 
\emph on
school bullies
\emph default
, and then 
\emph on
remember
\emph default
 it, and if she 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 it would've come out as `the skeleton is the key' and not `Susan Bones
 has to be there'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Millicent had been looking rather frightened at this point, so Hermione
 had relaxed her fists where they'd been jammed on her hips, calmed herself
 down, and stated carefully that she was glad Millicent had helped them,
 but they 
\emph on
had
\emph default
 sometimes walked into traps following what Millicent said, and so Hermione
 really did want to know where the messages had 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 come from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Millicent had said in a small voice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
 But, but she told
\emph default
 me 
\emph on
that she was a seer…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione had told Daphne not to press it, after Millicent had refused to
 give up her source.
 It wasn't just that Hermione had felt awful about the scared look on Millicent'
s face.
 It was that Hermione had a strong feeling that if they 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 find the person who'd been telling Millicent things, why, 
\emph on
they
\emph default
 would turn out to just be finding envelopes under their pillow in the morning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was getting that same despairing feeling she'd gotten in the battle
 before Christmas, looking at Zabini's charts with all the colored lines
 and boxes and… and she had only just now realized what it meant that 
\emph on
Zabini
\emph default
 had been the one showing her that chart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even for a Ravenclaw, she felt, there was such a thing as having your life
 get overly complicated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione began ascending a short spiral of yellow marble steps protruding
 from a central spine, a poorly-kept “secret” staircase that was actually
 one of the fastest ways up from the Slytherin dungeons to the Ravenclaw
 tower, but which only witches could traverse.
 (Why girls in particular needed a quick way to move from Ravenclaw to Slytherin
 and back was something Hermione found a bit puzzling.) At the top of the
 staircase, now that she was away from Slytherin places and back into the
 main parts of Hogwarts, Hermione stopped and took off Harry's invisibility
 cloak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After her pouch had swallowed the cloak, Hermione turned right and started
 to walk down a short passageway, now automatically keeping an eye out in
 all directions without really thinking about it, and her constantly-scanning
 eyes glanced into a shadowy alcove

 and then a rush of shock and fear hit her like a Stunning Hex over her

 her wand had leaped into her hand and was already pointed at…

\begin_layout Standard
…a black cloak so wide and billowing that it was impossible to determine
 whether the figure beneath was male or female, and atop the cloak a broad-brimm

 face of whoever or whatever might lie beneath.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hello again, Hermione,” whispered a sibilant voice from beneath the black
 hat, from behind the black mist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione's heart was already pounding hugely inside her chest, her witch's
 robes felt already sweat-dampened against her skin, there was a taste of
 fear already in her mouth; she didn't know why she was so suddenly filled
 up with adrenaline but her hand gripped harder on her wand.
 “Who are you?” Hermione demanded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hat tilted slightly; the whispery voice, when it came forth from the
 black mist, sounded dry as dust.
 “The last ally,” spoke the sibilant whisper.
 “The one who finally answers, when no other will answer you.

 “That is the riddle, young Ravenclaw.
 Until you solve it, you may call me whatever you wish.”

\begin_layout Standard
She could feel her palm already sweaty and was thankful for the spiral grooves
 on her wand that helped her hand keep a steady grip on the wood.
 “Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person,” Hermione said, “what do you
 want with me?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That is the wrong question,” came the whisper from black mist.
 “You should ask, rather, what

“No,” the young girl said quite steadily, “I don't think I

 “Not power,” whispered the voice, “not wealth, you care little for such

 That is what I possess.
 I know what is unfolding within this school, all the hidden plans and players,

“Good for you,” said Hermione Granger.
 “But do you know how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center
 of a Tootsie Pop?”

The black mist seemed to darken slightly, the voice sounded lower when it
 spoke, disappointed.
 “So you are not even curious, young Ravenclaw, about the truths behind
 the lies?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“One hundred and eighty-seven,” she said.
 “I tried it once and that's how many it came out to.” Her hand was almost

 she'd been holding the wand for hours instead of minutes
