\begin_layout Standard
That was what the Defense Professor had told Harry, after dropping the True
 Cloak of Invisibility to pool in fuliginous folds near Harry's shoes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The Mirror of Perfect Reflection has power over what is reflected within
 it, and that power is said to be unchallengeable.
 But since the True Cloak of Invisibility produces a perfect absence of
 image, it should evade this principle rather than challenging it.

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There had followed a series of questions in Parseltongue establishing that
 Harry currently did not intend to do anything stupid or try to run away,
 and further reminders that Professor Quirrell could sense him and had spells
 to detect the Cloak and was holding hostage hundreds of lives plus Hermione.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry was told to don the Cloak, open the door that lay beyond the
 quenched fires, and advance through the door into the final chamber; as
 Professor Quirrell stood well back, outside of that door's sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last chamber was illuminated in lights of soft gold, and the stone walls
 were of gentle white and faced with marble.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the center of the room stood a simple and unornamented golden frame,
 and within the frame was a portal to another gold-illuminated room, beyond
 whose door which lay another Potions chamber; that was what Harry's brain
 told him.
 The Mirror's transformation of light was so perfect that conscious thought
 was required to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a reflection,
 rather than a portal.
 (Though it might have been easier to intuit if Harry hadn't been invisible,
 just then.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Mirror did not touch the ground; the golden frame had no feet.
 It didn't look like it was hovering; it looked like it was fixed in place,
 more solid and more motionless than the walls themselves, like it was nailed
 to the reference frame of the Earth's motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Is the Mirror there? Is it moving?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 came Professor Quirrell's commanding voice from the Potions Chamber.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Iss there,
\emph default
” Harry hissed back.
 “
\emph on
Not moving.
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again tones of command rang forth.
 “Walk around to the back of the Mirror.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From behind, the golden frame appeared solid, showing no reflections, and
 Harry said so in Parseltongue.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Now take off your Cloak,” commanded Professor Quirrell's voice still from
 within the Potions room.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Report to me at once if the Mirror moves to face you.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry took off his Cloak.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Mirror remained nailed to the reference frame of Earth's motion; and
 Harry reported this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shortly after there came a hissing and seething, and a balefire phoenix
 melted through the marble wall behind Harry, the ambient light in the room
 taking on a red tinge as it entered.
 Professor Quirrell followed behind it, walking out of the new-made corridor
 that had been carved, his black formal shoes unharmed by the red-glowing
 molten surface beneath.
 “Well,” Professor Quirrell said, “that is one possible trap averted.
 And now...” Professor Quirrell exhaled.
 “Now we will think of possible strategies for retrieving the Stone from
 the Mirror, and you will try them; for I prefer not to let my own image
 be reflected.
 I give you fair warning, this is the part that may prove tedious.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I take it this isn't a problem you can solve with Fiendfyre?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ha,” said Professor Quirrell, and gestured.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The balefire phoenix moved forward in a rush of crimson terror, the red
 light casting writhing shadows on the remaining marble walls.
 Harry jumped back before he could think.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dreadful dark-red blaze rushed past Professor Quirrell, surged into
 the golden back of the Mirror, and disappeared as fast as it touched the
 gold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the fire was gone, and the room was tinged scarlet no more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no scratch upon the golden surface, no glow to mark the absorption
 of heat.
 The Mirror had simply remained in place, untouched.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chills went down Harry's spine.
 If he'd been playing Dungeons and Dragons and the dungeon master had reported
 that result, Harry would have suspected a mental illusion, and rolled to
 disbelieve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon the center of the golden back had appeared a sequence of runes in no
 known alphabet, black absences of light in small lines and curves, arranged
 in a level horizontal row.
 The thought occurred to Harry that some minor concealing illusion had been
 consumed in the Fiendfyre, a far lesser enchantment that had been added
 to prevent children from seeing those letters...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“How old is this Mirror?” Harry said in almost a whisper.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Nobody knows, Mr.
 Potter.” The Defense Professor reached out his fingers toward the runes,
 a look of something like reverence on his face; but his fingers did not
 touch the gold.
 “But my guess is the same as yours, I think.
 It is said, in certain legends that may or may not be fabrications, that
 this Mirror reflects 
\emph on
itself
\emph default
 perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely stable.
 So stable, in fact, that the Mirror and its contents were able to survive
 when every other effect of Atlantis was undone, all its products eliminated
 from Time.
 You can see why I was amused when you suggested Fiendfyre.” The Defense
 Professor let his hand fall.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in the middle of everything else, Harry felt the awe, if that was true.
 The golden frame gleamed no brighter than before, for all the revelation;
 but you could imagine it going back, and back, into a civilization that
 had been made to never exist.
 “What...
 what does the Mirror 
\emph on
do,
\emph default
 exactly?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“An excellent question,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “The answer is in the runes that are written upon the Mirror's golden frame.
 Read them to me.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“They're not in any alphabet I recognize.
 They look like randomly oriented chicken-scratches drawn by Tolkien elves.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Read them anyway.
 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The runes say, 
\emph on
noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton wo hsi
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\emph default
” Harry stopped, feeling more prickles at his spine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry knew what the rune for noitilov 
\emph on
meant
\emph default
.
 It meant noitilov.
 And the next runes said to detalo the noitilov until it reached partxe,
 then keep the part that was both tnere and hoc.
 That belief felt like knowledge, like he could have answered `Yes' with
 confident authority if somebody asked him whether the ton wo was ruoy or
 becafruoy.
 It was just that when Harry tried to relate those concepts to any other
 concepts, he drew a blank.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“Do you undersstand what wordss mean, boy?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
“Don't think sso.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell gave a soft exhalation, his eyes not leaving the golden
 frame.
 “I had wondered if perhaps the Words of False Comprehension might be understand
able to a student of Muggle science.
 Apparently not.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Maybe

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Maybe I could try again to understand the words if I knew more about the
 Mirror?” said Harry's Ravenclaw part, which had assumed direct control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell's lips quirked up.
 “As with most ancient things, scholars have written down enough lies that
 it is hard to be sure of anything by now.
 It is definite that the Mirror is at least as old as Merlin, for it is
 known that Merlin used it as a tool.
 It is also known that after his death, Merlin left written instructions
 that the Mirror did not need to be sealed away, despite it having certain
 powers that might normally cause one to worry.
 His exact wording was that, given how painstakingly the Mirror had been
 crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the world
 using a lump of cheese.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This statement struck Harry as not entirely reassuring.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Certain other facts about the Mirror are attested by famous wizards who
 were reasonably skeptical, and whose word has otherwise proven reliable.
 The Mirror's most characteristic power is to create alternate realms of
 existence, though these realms are only as large in size as what can be
 seen within the Mirror; it is known that people and other objects can be
 stored therein.
 It is claimed by several authorities that the Mirror alone of all magics
 possesses a true moral orientation, though I am not sure what that could
 mean in practical terms.
 I would expect people who believed in morality to call the Cruciatus Curse
 by their name of `evil' and the Patronus Charm by their name of `good';
 I cannot guess what a moralist would think was any 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 moral than that.
 But it is claimed, for example, that phoenixes came into our world from
 a realm that was evoked inside this Mirror.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words like 
\emph on
Jeepers
\emph default
 and what his parents would have termed inappropriate language were all
 running through Harry's head, none very coherently, as he stared at the
 golden back of the Mirror.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I have wandered the world and encountered many stories that are not often
 heard,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “Most of them seem to me to be lies, but a very few have the ring of history
 rather than storytelling.
 Upon a wall of metal in a place where no one had come for centuries, I
 found written the claim that some Atlanteans foresaw their world's end,
 and sought to forge a device of great power to avert the inevitable catastrophe.
 If that device had been completed, the story claimed, it would have become
 an absolutely stable existence that could withstand the channeling of unlimited
 magic in order to grant wishes.
 And also -- this was said to be the vastly harder task -- the device would
 somehow avert the inevitable catastrophes any sane person would expect
 to follow from that premise.
 The aspect I found interesting was that, according to the tale writ upon
 those metal plates, the rest of Atlantis ignored this project and went
 upon their ways.
 It was sometimes praised as a noble public endeavor, but nearly all other
 Atlanteans found more important things to do on any given day than help.
 Even the Atlantean nobles ignored the prospect of somebody other than themselve
s obtaining unchallengeable power, which a less experienced cynic might
 expect to catch their attention.
 With relatively little support, the tiny handful of would-be makers of
 this device labored under working conditions that were not so much dramatically
 arduous, as pointlessly annoying.
 Eventually time ran out and Atlantis was destroyed with the device still
 far from complete.
 I recognise certain echoes of my own experience that one does not usually
 see invented in mere tales.” A twist in the dry smile.
 “But perhaps that is merely my own preference for one tale among a hundred
 other legends.
 You perceive, however, the echo of Merlin's statement about the Mirror's
 creators carefully shaping it to not destroy the world.
 Most importantly for our purposes, it may explain why the Mirror would
 have the previously unknown capability that Dumbledore or Perenelle seems
 to have evoked, of showing any person who steps before it an illusion of
 a world in which one of their desires has been fulfilled.
 It is the sort of precaution you can imagine someone building into a wish-grant
ing creation meant to 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 destroy the world and 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 inevitably go horribly wrong.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Wow,” Harry whispered, and meant it.
 This was Magic with a capital M, the sort of Magic that appeared in 
\emph on
So You Want To Be A Wizard,
\emph default
 not just a collection of random physics-violating things you could do with
 a wand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell gestured at the golden back.
 “The final property upon which most tales agree, is that whatever the unknown
 means of commanding the Mirror -- of that Key there are no plausible accounts
 -- the Mirror's instructions cannot be shaped to react to individual people.
 So it is not possible for Perenelle to command this Mirror, `only give
 the Stone to Perenelle'.
 Dumbledore cannot state, `Only give the Stone to one who wishes to give
 it to Nicholas Flamel'.
 There is in the Mirror a blindness such as philosophers have attributed
 to ideal justice; it must treat all who come before it by the same rule,
 whatever rule may be in force.
 Thus, there must be some rule for reaching the Stone's hiding-place which
 anyone can invoke.
 And now you see why 
\emph on
you
\emph default
, called the Boy-Who-Lived, shall implement whatever strategies the two
 of us devise.
 For it was said that this thing possesses a moral orientation, and it may
 have been given commands reflecting the same.
 I am well aware that on conventional terms you are said to be Good, just
 as I am said to be Evil.” Professor Quirrell smiled, rather darkly.
 “So as our first attempt -- though not our last, rest assured -- let us
 see what this Mirror makes of your attempt to retrieve the Stone in order
 to save the life of Hermione Granger and hundreds of your fellow students.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 version of that plan,” said Harry, who was beginning to finally understand,
 “the one you invented on Friday in my first week of Hogwarts, called for
 the Stone to be retrieved by Dumbledore's golden child, the Boy-Who-Lived,
 making a selfless and noble attempt to save the life of his dying Defense
 teacher, Professor Quirrell.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course,” said Professor Quirrell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was a poetical sort of plot, Harry supposed, but his appreciation of
 that elegance was being hampered by the surrounding circumstances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then another thought occurred to Harry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Um,” Harry said.
 “You think that this Mirror is a trap for you
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There is no way beneath the heavens that it is not meant as a trap.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That is to say, it's a trap for Lord Voldemort.
 Only it can't be a trap for him personally.
 There has to be a general rule that underlies it, some generalizable quality
 of Lord Voldemort that triggers it.” Without conscious awareness, Harry
 was frowning hard at the Mirror's golden back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“As you say,” said Professor Quirrell, who was beginning to frown at Harry's
 frowning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, on the first Thursday of this year, the mad Headmaster Dumbledore,
 who I'd just seen incinerate a chicken, told me that I had no chance whatsoever
 of getting into his forbidden corridor, since I didn't know the spell 
\emph on
Alohomora.
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I 
\emph on
see,
\emph default
” said Professor Quirrell.
 “Oh, dear.
 I wish you had thought to mention this to me a good deal earlier.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither of them needed to state aloud the obvious, that this bit of reverse
 reverse psychology had successfully ensured that Harry would stay the heck
 away from Dumbledore's forbidden corridor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was still concentrating.
 “Do you think Dumbledore suspects that I am, in his terms, a horcrux of
 Lord Voldemort, or more generally, that some aspects of my personality
 were copied off Lord Voldemort?” Even as Harry asked this aloud, he realized
 what a dumb question it was, and how much completely blatant evidence he'd
 already seen that
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Dumbledore cannot 
\emph on
possibly
\emph default
 have missed it,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “It is not exactly subtle.
 What else is Dumbledore to think, that you are an actor in a play whose
 stupid author has never met a real eleven-year-old? Only a gibbering dullard
 with a skull full of flaming monkey vomit would think -- ah, never mind.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two of them stared at the Mirror in silence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally Professor Quirrell sighed.
 “I have outwitted myself, I fear.
 Neither you nor I dare be reflected in this Mirror.
 I suppose I must command Professor Sprout to undo my Obliviations of Mr.
 Nott and Miss Greengrass...
 You see, the other great difficulty of the Mirror is that the rule by which
 it treats those reflected will disregard external forces, such as False
 Memories or a Confundus Charm.
 The Mirror reflects only those forces arising from within the person themselves
, the states of mind they arrive at through their own choices; so it is
 said in several places.
 That is why I had Mr.
 Nott and Miss Greengrass, believing different stories about why the Stone's
 extraction was necessary, ready to appear before this Mirror.” Professor
 Quirrell rubbed at the bridge of his nose.
 “I constructed other stories for other students, all done without direct
 mind magic on them, ready for me to set into motion with the chosen trigger...
 but as the critical day approached, I began to feel pessimistic about the
 entire project.
 Such as Nott and Greengrass still seem worth trying, if we cannot think
 of something better.
 But I wonder if Dumbledore has tried to construct this puzzle to specifically
 resist my own cunning.
 I wonder if he might perhaps have succeeded.
 So I have decided to consult you, before I send in my student pawns.
 If you do devise an alternative plan that seems good to me, 
\emph on
I promisse that whatever pawn I ssend forth sshall not be harmed by me,
 then or ever; nor do I expect to break that promisse
\emph default
.
 And I remind you again of the hostages I hold to my failure, both Miss
 Granger and all the others.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again they stared at the mirror in silence, the elder Tom Riddle and the
 younger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I suspect, Professor,” Harry said after a time, “that your entire class
 of hypotheses about somebody needing to want the Stone for good or honest
 purposes is mistaken.
 The Headmaster wouldn't set a retrieval rule like that in the first place.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Why?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Because Dumbledore knows how easy it is to end up believing that you're
 doing the right thing when you're actually not.
 It'd be the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 possibility he imagined, if he considered a rule like that.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Iss it truth or trickery that I hear?
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Am being honesst,
\emph default
” Harry said.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell nodded.
 “Then your point is well taken.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm not sure why you think this puzzle is solvable,” Harry said.
 “Just set a rule like, your left hand must hold a small blue pyramid and
 two large red pyramids, and your right hand must be squeezing mayonnaise
 onto a hamster

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “No, I think not.
 The legends are unclear on what rules can be given, but I think it must
 have something to do with the Mirror's original intended use -- it must
 have something to do with the deep desires and wishes arising from within
 the person.
 Squeezing mayonnaise onto a hamster will not qualify as that, for most
 people.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Huh,” Harry said.
 “Maybe the rule is that the person has to not want to use the Stone themselves
 -- no, that's too easy, you already solved that rule with the story you
 gave Mr.
 Nott.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“In some ways you may understand Dumbledore better than I,” said Professor
 Quirrell.
 “So now I ask you this: how would Dumbledore use his notion of the acceptance
 of death to guard this Stone? For that above all he thinks I cannot comprehend,
 and he is not far wrong.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry thought about this for a while, considering several ideas and discarding
 them.
 And then, having thought of something, Harry considered remaining silent...
 before mapping out the obvious part of the future conversation where Professor
 Quirrell asked him to say in Parseltongue if he'd thought of something.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reluctantly, Harry spoke.
 “Would Dumbledore think that this Mirror could reach the afterlife? Could
 he put the Stone into something that he 
\emph on
thinks
\emph default
 is an afterlife, so that only people who believe in an afterlife can see
 it?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hm...” Professor Quirrell said slowly.
 “Possibly...
 yes, there is a certain plausibility to it.
 Using this setting of the Mirror to show people their heart's desires...
 Albus Dumbledore would see himself reunited with his family.
 He would see himself united with them 
\emph on
in death,
\emph default
 wanting to die himself rather than wishing for them to be returned to life.
 His brother Aberforth, his sister Ariana, his parents Kendra and Percival...
 it would be Aberforth to whom Dumbledore gave the Stone, I think.
 Would the Mirror recognize that Aberforth particularly had been given the
 Stone? Or will any person's dead relative do, if that person believes their
 relative's spirit would give them back the Stone? How can that belief be
 arranged in some suitable pawn, on short notice, without magic?” Professor
 Quirrell was pacing in a short circle, keeping well away from Harry and
 the Mirror as he moved.
 “But all this is only one idea.
 Let us devise another.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry began to tap his cheek, then stopped abruptly as he realized where
 he'd picked up that gesture.
 “What if Perenelle is the one who put the Stone in here? Maybe she keyed
 the Mirror to give the Stone only to the one who put it in originally.”
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Perenelle has lived this long by knowing her limitations,” said Professor
 Quirrell.
 “She does not overestimate her own intellect, she is not prideful, if that
 were so she would have lost the Stone long ago.
 Perenelle will not try to think of a good Mirror-rule herself, not when
 Master Flamel can leave the matter in Dumbledore's wiser hands...
 but the rule you named, of only returning the Stone to the one who remembers
 placing it, also works if Dumbledore himself has placed the Stone.
 It would be a hard rule to bypass, since I cannot simply Confund someone
 into believing that they put in the Stone...
 I would have to create a false Stone, and a false Mirror, and arrange the
 drama...” Professor Quirrell was frowning, now.
 “But it is still something that Dumbledore would imagine Voldemort being
 able to arrange, given enough time.
 If at all possible, Dumbledore will want to make the key to the Mirror
 a state of mind he thinks I 
\emph on
cannot
\emph default
 arrange in a pawn -- or a rule that Dumbledore thinks Voldemort can never
 comprehend, such as a rule involving the acceptance of one's own death.
 That is why I considered your previous idea plausible.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Harry had an idea.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was not sure if it was a good idea.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

it wasn't like Harry had a lot of choice here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Arguendo,” Harry said.
 “We're not sure what's necessary to retrieve the Stone.
 But a 
\emph on
sufficient
\emph default
 condition should involve Albus Dumbledore, or maybe someone else, in a
 state of mind where they believe that the Dark Lord has been defeated,
 that the threat is over, and that it is time to take out the Stone and
 give it back to Nicholas Flamel.
 We aren't sure which part of that person's state of mind, let's say Dumbledore'
s, will be the necessary part that he thinks Lord Voldemort can't understand
 or duplicate; but under those conditions Dumbledore's entire state of mind
 will be 
\emph on
sufficient.
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Reasonable,” said Professor Quirrell.
 “So?” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The corresponding strategy,” Harry said carefully, “is to mimic Dumbledore's
 state of mind under those conditions, in as much detail as possible, while
 standing in front of the mirror.
 And this state of mind must have been produced by internal forces, not
 external ones.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But how are we to get that without Legilimency or the Confundus Charm,
 both of which would certainly be external -- ha.
 I 
\emph on
see.
\emph default

 “You suggest that I Confund

myself,

 just as you cast that hex upon yourself during your first day in Battle
 Magic.
 So that it is an internal force and not an external one, a state of mind

 Say to me whether you have made this suggestion with the intention of trapping

 Say it to me in Parseltongue.”

\begin_layout Standard
“Lovely,” said Professor Quirrell, who

was
\emph default
 smiling.
 “I suppose there are some threats from an inventive mind that even questioning
 in Parseltongue cannot neutralize.”

The first thing Harry had to do was strip off all his clothes, and his shoes,
 and everything else he was wearing except his glasses; without his wand,
 Harry couldn't unstick his glasses from his own forehead, and neither could
 Professor Quirrell because of the magical resonance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Immediately after that, Harry put on the Cloak of Invisibility, at Professor
 Quirrell's orders, to 
\emph on
sstop the man who sshall believe himsself to be sschoolmasster from sseeing
 you,
\emph default
 as Professor Quirrell said in Parseltongue.

\begin_layout Standard
“Wearing the Cloak or no, you will stand in range of the Mirror yourself,”
 Professor Quirrell said.
 “If a gush of lava comes forth, you will also burn.
 I feel that much symmetry should apply.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So Harry, wearing the Cloak, stood where Professor Quirrell had pointed
 him, and did not argue.
 It was increasingly unclear to Harry that it 
\emph on
wasn't
\emph default
 worth his own life plus hundreds of student hostages to stop Professor
 Quirrell.
 For all of Harry's good intentions, he'd mostly shown himself so far to
 be an idiot, and the returned Professor Quirrell was a threat to the entire
 world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Though either way, Harry couldn't see Dumbledore doing the lava thing.
 For one thing, it wouldn't permanently stop an entity that Dumbledore believed
 to be a discorporate soul.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Professor Quirrell pointed with his wand, and a shimmering circle appeared
 around where Harry was standing on the floor.
 This, Professor Quirrell said, would soon become a Greater Circle of Concealmen
t, by which nothing within that circle could be heard or seen from the outside.
 Harry would not be able to make himself apparent to the false Dumbledore
 by taking off the Cloak, nor by shouting.
 He had no clothes left to throw across.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You 
\emph on
will not
\emph default
 cross this circle once it is active,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “That would cause you to touch my magic, and while Confunded I might not
 remember how to halt the resonance that would destroy us both.
 Also, 
\emph on
material objectss crosssing, like fingernailss or Cloak, will not break
 circle,
\emph default
 so get no bright ideas there.
 Now tell me in Parseltongue that you do not intend to cross this circle
 or take off your Cloak or do 
\emph on
anything
\emph default
 at all impulsive or stupid.
 Tell you me you will wait quietly here, under the Cloak, until this is
 over.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Harry repeated back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Professor Quirrell's robes became black tinged with gold, such robes
 as Dumbledore might wear upon a formal occasion; and Professor Quirrell
 pointed his own wand at his head.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell stayed motionless for a long time, still holding his
 wand to his head.
 His eyes were closed in concentration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Professor Quirrell said, “
\emph on
Confundus.
\emph default
” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At once the expression of the man standing there changed; he blinked a few
 times, as though confused, lowering his wand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A deep weariness spread over the face Professor Quirrell had worn; without
 any visible change his eyes seemed older, the few lines in his face calling
 attention to themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
His lips were set in a sad smile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without any hurry, the man quietly walked over to the Mirror, as though
 he had all the time in the world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He crossed into the Mirror's range of reflection without anything happening,
 and stared into the surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What the man might be seeing there, Harry could not tell; to Harry it seemed
 that the flat, perfect surface still reflected the room behind it, like
 a portal to another place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ariana,” breathed the man.
 “Mother, father.
 And you, my brother, it is done.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man stood still, as if listening.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, done,” the man said.
 “Voldemort came before this mirror, and was trapped.
 He is only one more sealed horror now.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again the listening stillness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I would that I could obey you, my brother, but it is better this way.” The
 man bowed his head.
 “He is denied his death, forever; that vengeance is terrible enough.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry felt a twinge, watching this, a sense that this was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 what Dumbledore would have said, it seemed more like a shallow stereotype...
 but then this wasn't the real Aberforth's spirit either, this was who Professor
 Quirrell imagined Dumbledore imagined Aberforth was, and that doubly-reflected
 image of Aberforth wouldn't notice anything amiss...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“It is time to give back the Philosopher's Stone,” said the man who thought
 he was Dumbledore.
 “It must go back into Master Flamel's keeping, now.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Listening stillness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said the man, “Master Flamel has kept it safe these many years from
 all who would seek immortality, and I think it will be safest in his hands...
 no, Aberforth, I do think his intentions are good.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry couldn't control the tension that was running through him like a live
 wire; he was having trouble breathing.
 Imperfect, Professor Quirrell's Confundus Charm had been imperfect.
 The underlying personality of Professor Quirrell was leaking through and
 seeing the obvious question, why it was okay for Nicholas Flamel himself
 to have the Stone if immortality was so awful.
 Even if Professor Quirrell conceptualized Dumbledore as being blind to
 the question, Professor Quirrell hadn't included a clause in the Confundus
 saying that 
\emph on
Dumbledore's image of Aberforth
\emph default
 wouldn't think of it; and all of this was ultimately a reflection of Professor
 Quirrell's own mind, an image from within the intelligence of Tom Riddle...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Destroy it?” said the man.
 “Maybe.
 I am not sure it 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be destroyed, or Master Flamel would have done it long since.
 I think, many times, that he has regretted making it...
 Aberforth, I promised him, and we are not so ancient or so wise ourselves.
 The Philosopher's Stone must go back into the keeping of the one who made
 it.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Harry's breath stopped.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man was holding an irregular chunk of scarlet glass in his left hand,
 the size perhaps of Harry's thumb from fingernail to the first joint.
 The sheened surface of the scarlet glass made it seem wet; the appearance
 was of blood, suspended in time and made into a jagged surface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Thank you, my brother,” the man said quietly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Is that what the Stone should look like? Does Professor Quirrell know what
 the true Stone should look like? Will the Mirror give back the real Stone
 under these conditions, or make an imitation and return that?
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then

\begin_layout Standard
“No, Ariana,” the man said, smiling gently, “I fear I must go now.
 Be patient, my dearest, it will be soon enough that I join you in truth...
 why? Why, I am not sure why I must go...
 when I hold the Stone I am to step aside from the Mirror and wait for Master
 Flamel to contact me, but I am not sure why I need to step aside from the
 Mirror to do that...” The man sighed.
 “Ah, I am getting old.
 It is well this dreadful war ended when it did.
 I suppose there is no harm if I speak to you for a time, my dearest, if
 you wish it so.” 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A headache was starting behind Harry's eyes; some part of Harry was trying
 to send a message about not having breathed in a while, but no one was
 listening.
 
\emph on
Imperfect
\emph default
, Professor Quirrell's Confundus Charm had been imperfect, Professor Quirrell's
 image of Dumbledore's image of Ariana wanted to talk to Dumbledore, and
 maybe didn't want to wait because Professor Quirrell knew on some level
 that there wasn't really an afterlife, and the previously implanted impulse
 to leave after getting the Stone 
\emph on
wasn't standing up to Riddle-Ariana's arguments...

\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then Harry felt himself become very calm.
 He started breathing again.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It wasn't like there was much Harry could do about it.
 Take off the Cloak of Invisibility and throw it, that was the only thing
 left that Harry could try, and Professor Quirrell had made Harry promise
 not to try that.
 Well, Professor Quirrell was welcome to reap the consequences; and if the
 consequences caught Harry as well, so be it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man who thought he was Dumbledore was mostly nodding patiently, sometimes
 replying to his dearest sister.
 Sometimes the man cast an uneasy look to one side; as if feeling a strong
 impulse to go, but suppressing that impulse with the great patience and
 politeness and concern for his sister that Professor Quirrell imagined
 Albus Dumbledore having.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry saw it the instant the Confundus wore off, and the man's expression
 changed, becoming again the face of Professor Quirrell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And in the same instant the Mirror changed, no longer showing Harry the
 reflection of the room, showing instead the form of the real Albus Dumbledore,
 as though he were standing just behind the Mirror and visible through it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real Dumbledore's face was set, and grim.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hello, Tom,” said Albus Dumbledore.
