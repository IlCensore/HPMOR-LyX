Harry dipped a finger in the glass of water on his desk.
 It should have been cool.
 But lukewarm it was, and lukewarm it had stayed.
 Again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was feeling very, very cheated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were hundreds of fantasy novels scattered around the Verres household.
 Harry had read quite a few.
 And it was starting to look like he had a mysterious dark side.
 So after the glass of water had refused to cooperate the first few times,
 Harry had glanced around the Charms classroom to make sure no one was watching,
 and then taken a deep breath, concentrated, and made himself angry.
 Thought about the Slytherins bullying Neville, and the game where someone
 knocked down your books every time you tried to pick them up again.
 Thought about what Draco Malfoy had said about the ten-year-old Lovegood
 girl and how the Wizengamot really operated…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the fury had entered his blood, he had held out his wand in a hand that
 trembled with hate and said in cold tones “
\emph on
Frigideiro!
\emph default
” and absolutely nothing had happened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had been 
\emph on
gypped.

\emph default
 He wanted to write someone and demand a 
\emph on
refund
\emph default
 on his dark side which clearly 
\emph on
ought
\emph default
 to have irresistible magical power but had turned out to be 
\emph on
defective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“
\emph on
Frigideiro!
\emph default
” said Hermione again from the desk next to him.
 Her water was solid ice and there were white crystals forming on the rim
 of her glass.
 She seemed to be totally intent on her own work and not at all conscious
 of the other students staring at her with hateful eyes, which was either
 (a) dangerously oblivious of her or (b) a perfectly honed performance rising
 to the level of fine art.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh, 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 good, Miss Granger!” squeaked Filius Flitwick, their Charms Professor and
 Head of Ravenclaw, a tiny little man with no visible signs of being a past
 dueling champion.
 “Excellent! Stupendous!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry had expected to be, in the worst case, second behind Hermi\SpecialChar \-
one.
 Harry would have preferred for 
\emph on
her
\emph default
 to be rivalling 
\emph on
him,
\emph default
 of course, but he could have accepted it the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of Monday, Harry was headed for the bottom of the class, a position for
 which he was companionably rivalling all the other Muggle-raised students
 except Hermione.
 Who was all alone and rivalless at the top, poor thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Flitwick was standing over the desk of one of the other Muggleborns
 and quietly adjusting the way she was holding her wand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry looked over at Hermione.
 He swallowed hard.
 It was the obvious role for her in the scheme of things… “Hermione?” Harry
 said tentatively.
 “Do you have any idea what I might be doing wrong?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hermione's eyes lit up with a terrible light of helpfulness and something
 in the back of Harry's brain screamed in desperate humiliation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Five minutes later, Harry's water did seem noticeably cooler than room temperatu
re and Hermione had given him a few verbal pats on the head and told him
 to pronounce it more carefully next time and gone off to help someone else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Flitwick had given her a House point for helping him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry was gritting his teeth so hard his jaw ached and that wasn't helping
 his pronunciation.

“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will
 learn at Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall.
 There was no trace of any levity upon the face of the stern old witch.
 “Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.
 You have been warned.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her wand came down and tapped her desk, which smoothly reshaped itself into
 a pig.
 A couple of Muggleborn students gave out small yelps.
 The pig looked around and snorted, seeming confused, and then became a
 desk again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Transfiguration Professor looked around the classroom, and then her
 eyes settled on one student.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Mr.

 “You only received your schoolbooks a few days ago.

“No, sorry professor,” Harry said.

Potter, if you were required to read ahead you would have been told to do

 “Mr.

Potter, would you care to guess whether this is a desk which I Transfigured
 into a pig, or if it began as a pig and I briefly removed the Transfiguration?
 If you had read the first chapter of your textbook, you would know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly.
 “I'd guess it'd be easier to start with a pig, since if it started as a
 desk, it might not know how to stand up.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall shook her head.
 “No fault to you, Mr.
\begin_inset ERT

Potter, but the correct answer is that in Transfiguration you do 
\emph on
not

 care to guess.
 Wrong answers will be marked with extreme severity, questions left blank
 will be marked with great leniency.
 You must learn to know what you do not know.
 If I ask you any question, no matter how obvious or elementary, and you
 answer `I'm not sure', I will not hold it against you and anyone who laughs
 will lose House points.
 Can you tell me why this rule exists, Mr.

\begin_layout Standard

Because a single error in Transfiguration can be incredibly dangerous.

\emph default
 “No.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Correct.
 Transfiguration is more dangerous than Apparition, which is not taught
 until your sixth year.
 Unfortunately, Transfiguration must be learned and practised at a young
 age to maximise your adult ability.
 So this is a dangerous subject, and you should be quite scared of making
 any mistakes, because none of my students have ever been permanently injured
 and I will be 
\emph on
extremely put out

 if you are the first class to 
\emph on

Several students gulped.

Potter, suppose a student Transfigured a block of wood into a cup of water,

 there might be… wood in my stomach, and in my bloodstream, and if any of
 that water had gotten absorbed into my body's tissues -- would it be wood
 pulp or solid wood or…” Harry's grasp of magic failed him.
 He couldn't understand how wood mapped into water in the first place, so
 he couldn't understand what would happen after the water molecules were
 scrambled by ordinary thermal motions and the magic wore off and the mapping
 reversed.

“Professor,” Harry said, “if the worst happens in a case like that, is there
 any way of

maintaining

 the Transfiguration?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” Professor McGonagall said flatly.
 “Sustaining a Transfiguration is a constant drain on your magic which scales
 with the size of the target form.
 And you would need to recontact the target every few hours, which is, in
 a case like this, impossible.
 Disasters like this are 
\emph on
unrecoverable!

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, her face very hard.
 “You will absolutely never under any circumstances Transfigure anything
 into a liquid or a gas.
 No water, no air.
 Nothing like water, nothing like air.
 Even if it is not meant to drink.
 Liquid

 You will not Transfigure anything that is to be burned.
 It will make smoke and someone could breathe that smoke! You will never

 No food.

\begin_layout Standard
“You will never Transfigure anything that looks like money, including Muggle
 money,” said Professor McGonagall.
 “The goblins have ways of finding out who did it.
 As a matter of recognised law, the goblin nation is in a permanent state

 They will not send Aurors.

 as physical form is concerned.
 For this reason, free Transfiguration must be done wordlessly.
 Using Charms would require different words for every different transformation

\begin_layout Standard
Professor McGonagall gave her students a sharp look.
 “

Some

 afterwards.
 Yes, that would be much easier in the beginning.
 But it can set you in a poor mold which impairs your abilities later.

 to the surrounding air.
 When the Transfiguration wears off and your body tries to revert to its

 If you press your wand to your body and imagine yourself with golden hair,

That explained why he had seen such things as fat boys, or girls less than

 Or old people, for that matter.

Potter,” sang Professor McGonagall from the other side of the room, “I have
 some good news for you.
 Madam Pomfrey has approved your suggestion for preventing breakage in her
 Spimster wickets, and the plan is to finish the job by the end of next
 week.
 I'd say that deserves… let's call it ten points for Ravenclaw.”

Hermione's face was gaping in betrayal and shock.
 Harry imagined his own face didn't look much different.

Potter.
 I would not hand out House points on a whim.
 To you it might have been a simple matter of seeing something fragile and
 suggesting a way to protect it, but Spimster wickets are expensive, and
 the Headmaster was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 pleased the last time one broke.” Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful.
 “My, I wonder if any other student has ever earned seventeen House points
 on his first day of lessons.
 I'll have to look it up, but I suspect that's a new record.
 Perhaps we should have an announcement at dinnertime?”

 Unless, of course, you engage in some sort of mischief and

 House points before then.
 Addressing a professor disrespectfully, for example.” Professor McGonagall
 put a finger on her cheek and looked reflective.
 “I expect you'll hit negative numbers before the end of Friday.”

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's mouth snapped shut.
 He sent his best Death Glare at McGonagall but she only seemed to find
 it amusing.

\begin_layout Standard
“Yes, definitely an announcement at dinner,” Professor McGonagall mused.
 “But it wouldn't do to offend the Slytherins, so the announcement should
 be brief.
 Just the number of points and the fact of the record… and if anyone comes
 to you for help with their schoolwork and is disappointed that you haven't
 even started reading your textbooks, you can always refer them to Miss
 Granger.”

“

Professor McGonagall ignored her.
 “My, I wonder how long it will take before Miss Granger does something
 deserving of a dinnertime announcement? I look forward to seeing it, whatever
 it may be.”

Harry and Hermione, by unspoken mutual consent, turned and stormed out of
 the classroom.
 They were followed by a trail of hypnotised Ravenclaws.

“Um,” Harry said.
 “Are we still on for after dinner?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Of course,” said Hermione.
 “I wouldn't want you to fall further behind on your studying.”

\begin_layout Standard
“Why, thank you.
 And let me say that as brilliant as you are already, I can't help but wonder
 what you'll be like once you have some elementary training in rationality.”

“Well, I only got my schoolbooks four days ago.
 That's why I had to earn those seventeen House points without using my
 wand.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Four days ago? Maybe you can't read eight books in four days but you might
 have at least read 
\emph on
one

 How many days will it take to finish at that rate? You know all that mathematic
s, so can you tell me what's eight, times four, divided by zero?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I've got classes now, which you didn't, but weekends are free, so… limit

 10:47am on Sunday.”
