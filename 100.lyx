 Filch's face appeared twisted in the light of the oil lamp he held, shadows
 dancing over his face.
 Behind them the doors of Hogwarts quickly receded, and the dark grounds
 moved closer.
 The track they now walked was muddy and indistinct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trees, branches formerly bare with winter, were not yet fully clad with
 spring; their branches stretched up toward the sky like lean fingers, skeletons
 visible amid the thin foliage.
 The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it often threw them into
 darkness, lit only by the dim flames of Filch's lamp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco kept a firm grip on his wand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Where are you taking us?” said Tracey Davis.
 She'd been caught along with Draco by Filch, on their way to an attempted
 meeting of the Silvery Slytherins after curfew hours, and likewise given
 a detention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You just follow me,” said Argus Filch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco was feeling rather annoyed with the whole affair.
 The Silvery Slytherins ought to be recognized school business.
 There was no reason why a secret conspiracy shouldn't have permission to
 meet after curfew, if it was for the greater good of Hogwarts.
 If this happened one more time he'd talk to Daphne Greengrass and Daphne
 would talk to her father and then Filch would learn the wisdom of looking
 the other way where Malfoys were concerned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lights of the Hogwarts castle had diminished in the distance when Filch
 spoke again.
 “I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you,
 eh?” Filch turned his head, away from the lamp, so that he could leer at
 the four students following him.
 “Oh yes… hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me… It's just
 a pity they let the old punishments die out… hang you by your wrists from
 the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep
 `em well oiled in case they're ever needed…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Hey!” Tracey said, a touch of indignation entering her voice.
 “I'm too young to hear about that -- that sort of -- you know! Especially
 if the chains are well-oiled!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco wasn't paying attention.
 Filch simply wasn't in Amycus Carrow's league.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind them, one of the two older Slytherins following them snickered, though
 she didn't say anything.
 Beside her was the other, a tall boy with an Slavic cast to his face, and
 who still spoke with an accent.
 They'd been caught for some unrelated offense, having to do with the type
 of thing Tracey went on about, and looked to be in their third or fourth
 year.
 “Pfeh,” said the taller boy.
 “In Durmstrang they hang you upside-down by your toes.
 By one toe, if you are insolent.
 Hogwarts was soft even in the old days.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Argus Filch was silent for around half a minute, as though trying to think
 of a proper rejoinder, and then gave a chuckle.
 “We'll see what you say about that… when you learn what you'll be doing
 tonight! Ha!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I 
\emph on
said,
\emph default
 I'm too young for that sort of thing!” said Tracey Davis.
 “It has to wait until I'm older!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ahead of them was a cottage with lighted windows, though the proportions
 seemed wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filch whistled, a high sharp sound, and a dog began barking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the cottage stepped forth a figure, making the trees seem too short
 around it.
 The figure was followed by a dog that seemed like a puppy by comparison,
 until you looked at it apart from the taller silhouette and realized the
 dog was huge, more like a wolf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco's eyes narrowed, before he caught himself.
 As a Silvery Slytherin he wasn't supposed to be Prejudiced against any
 sentient being, especially not where other people might see him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What's this?” said the figure, in the loud gruff voice of the half-giant.
 His umbrella lit up with a white glow, brighter than Filch's dim lamp.
 In his other hand he held a crossbow; a quiver of short bolts was strapped
 to his upper arm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Students serving detention,” Filch said, loudly.
 “They're to help you search the Forest for… whatever's been eating `em.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“The 
\emph on
Forest?
\emph default
” gasped Tracey.
 “We can't go in there at night!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's right,” said Filch, turning from Hagrid to glare at them.
 “It's into the Forest you're going, and I'm much mistaken if you'll all
 come out in one piece.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But
\begin_inset space ~

--” said Tracey.
 “There's werewolves, I've heard,
\emph on
 and
\emph default
 vampires, and everyone knows what happens when there's a girl and a werewolf
 and a vampire all at the same time!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The huge half-giant was frowning.
 “Argus, I `ad in mind you an' maybe a few seventh-years.
 `Ere's not much point in bringing along help if I'm to watch over `em the
 whole time.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Argus's face lit with cruel satisfaction.
 “That's their lookout, isn't it? Should've thought of them werewolves before
 they got in trouble, shouldn't they? Send them out alone.
 I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid.
 They're here to be punished, after all.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The half-giant gave a massive sigh (it sounded like a normal man having
 all the air driven out of his lungs by a Bludgeoning Hex).
 “Yeh've done yer bit.
 I'll take over from here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what's left of them,” he added
 nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing
 away in the darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, `cause it's dangerous
 what we're gonna do tonight an' I don' want no one takin' risks.
 Follow me over here a moment.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He led them to the very edge of the Forest.
 Holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track
 that disappeared into the thick black trees.
 A light breeze blew over Draco's head as he looked into the Forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There's summat in there that's bin eatin' unicorns,” the huge man said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco nodded; he distantly remembered hearing something along those lines
 a couple of weeks ago, toward the end of April.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Did you call us to track down a trail of silvery blood to a wounded unicorn?”
 Tracey said excitedly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No,” said Draco, though he managed to stop the reflexive sneer.
 “Filch gave us the detention note at lunch today, at noon.
 Mr.
 Hagrid wouldn't wait that long to find a wounded unicorn, and if we were
 looking for something like that, we'd look in the day when it's bright.
 So,” Draco held up a finger, like he'd seen Inspector León do in plays,
 “I infer that we're looking for something that only comes out at night.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Aye,” said the half-giant, sounding thoughtful.
 “Yer not what I expected, Draco Malfoy.
 Not what I expected at all.
 An' you'd be Tracey Davis, then.
 I've heard of yeh.
 One of poor Miss Granger's lot.” Rubeus Hagrid looked over at the two older
 Slytherins, peering at them in the light of his glowing umbrella.
 “An' who'd yeh be, again? Don't remember seeing much of yeh, boy.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Cornelia Walt,” said the witch, “and this is Yuri Yuliy,” indicating the
 Slavic-looking boy who'd spoken of Durmstrang.
 “His family is visiting from the Ukrainian lands, so he's in Hogwarts just
 for the year.” The older boy nodded, a faintly contemptuous cast on his
 face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“This is Fang,” Hagrid said, indicating the dog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The five of them set off into the woods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What could be killing unicorns?” Draco said after they'd walked for a few
 minutes.
 Draco knew a bit about Dark creatures, but he couldn't remember anything
 that was said to prey on unicorns.
 “What sort of creature does that, does anyone know?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Werewolves!” said Tracey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Miss Davis?” Draco said, and when she looked at him, he silently pointed
 a finger up at the moon.
 It was waxing gibbous, but not yet full.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Oh, right,” said Tracey.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No weres in the Forest,” said Hagrid.
 “They're plain wizards most o' the time, `member.
 Couldn't be wolves either, they're not near fast enough ter catch a unicorn.
 Powerful magical creatures, unicorns are, I never knew one ter be hurt
 before.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco listened to this, thinking about the puzzle almost despite himself.
 “Then what 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 fast enough to catch a unicorn?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Wouldn't `ave been a matter of speed,” Hagrid said, giving Draco an indeciphera
ble glance.
 “Ere's no end ter the ways that creatures hunt.
 Poison, darkness, traps.
 Imps as can't be seen or heard or remembered, even while they're eatin'
 yer face.
 Always summat new an' wonderful to learn.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cloud passed over the moon, casting the forest into shadow lit only by
 the glow of Hagrid's umbrella.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Meself,” Hagrid continued, “I think we might `ave a Parisian hydra on our
 `ands.
 They're no threat to a wizard, yeh've just got to keep holdin' `em off
 long enough, and there's no way yeh can lose.
 I mean literally no way yeh can lose so long's yeh keep fightin'.
 Trouble is, against a Parisian hydra, most creatures give up long before.
 Takes a while to cut down all the heads, yeh see.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Bah,” said the foreign boy.
 “In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buchholz hydra.
 Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannot imagine.
 First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible! Instructor
 must give second order, iterate until they comprehend.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the Forest,
 until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were
 so thick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then Draco saw it, thick splashes on the roots of trees, gleaming a brighter
 color beneath the moonlight.
 “Is that --”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Unicorn's blood,” Hagrid said.
 The huge man's voice was sad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a clearing ahead, visible through the tangled branches of a great oak,
 they saw the fallen creature, splayed beautiful and sad upon the ground,
 the dirt around her shining moon-silver with pooled blood.
 The unicorn was not white, but pale blue, or appearing so beneath the moon
 and night sky.
 Her slender legs stuck out at odd angles, obviously broken, and her mane
 spread across the dark leaves, green-black but with a sheen like pearls.
 On her flank was a small white shape like a starburst, a center surrounded
 by eight straight rays.
 Half her side had been ripped away, the edges ragged like the marks of
 teeth, bones and inner organs exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strange choking sensation rose in Draco's throat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's `er,” Hagrid said, his sad whisper as loud as a normal man's voice.
 “Just where I found `er this mornin', dead as a dead doorknob.
 She is -- was -- the first unicorn I e'er met in these woods.
 I called `er Alicorn, not that it matters ter `er any more, I s'pose.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You named a unicorn Alicorn,” said the older girl.
 Her voice was a bit dry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But she doesn't have wings,” Tracey said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“An alicorn's a unicorn's horn,” Hagrid said, now louder.
 “Don't know where yeh all started thinking it meant a unicorn with wings,
 `ere's no such thing I ever heard.
 It's just like naming a dog Fang,” indicating the huge wolf-like dog that
 barely came to his knees.
 “What'd you have called `er? Hannah, or some such? I gave `er a name as
 would've meant summat ter 
\emph on
'er.

\emph default
 Common courtesy, I call it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nobody said anything to this, and after a further moment, the huge man gave
 a sharp nod.
 “We'll start our search from `ere, the last place it struck.
 We're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent direction
s.
 Yeh two, Walt and Yuliy -- yeh'll go that way, and take Fang.
 There's nothin' that lives in the Forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with Fang.
 Send up green sparks if yeh find summat interestin', an' send up red sparks
 if anyone gets in trouble.
 Davis, Malfoy, with me.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Forest was black and silent.
 Rubeus Hagrid had dimmed the light of his umbrella after they'd set out,
 so that Draco and Tracey had to steer themselves by the light of the moon,
 not without occasional trips and falls.
 They walked past a mossy tree-stump, the sound of running water speaking
 of a stream somewhere close by.
 Now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of
 silver blue blood on the fallen leaves; they were following the trail of
 blood, toward where the creature must have first struck the unicorn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“There's rumors about yeh,” Hagrid said in a low voice after they'd walked
 for a while.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, they're all true,” Tracey said.
 
\emph on
“All
\emph default
 of them.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not yeh,” Hagrid said.
 “Did yeh really testify under Veritaserum that yeh tried to help Miss Granger,
 three times it was?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco weighed his words for a while, and finally said, “Yes.” It wouldn't
 have done to appear too eager to claim credit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The huge man shook his head, his great feet still stomping silently through
 the woods.
 “I'm surprised, teh be honest.
 And yeh too, Davis, tryin' to put the halls in order.
 Are yeh sure the Sorting Hat put yeh in the right place? There's not a
 single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin, so it's always
 been said.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“That's not true,” Tracey said.
 “What about Xiaonan Tong the Black Raven, Spencer of the Hill, and Mister
 Kayvon?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Who?” said Hagrid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Just some of the best Dark Wizards from the last two centuries,” Tracey
 said.
 “They're probably 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 best from Hogwarts who weren't from Slytherin.” Her voice fell, lost its
 enthusiasm.
 “Miss Granger always told me I should read up on anything I

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“

Anyway

,” Draco said quickly, “that's not really relevant, Mr.
 Hagrid.
 Even if

 between 
\emph on
probability of Slytherin given Dark
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
probability of Dark given Slytherin
\emph default
 into nonscientific language.
 “Even if most Dark Wizards are from Slytherin, very few Slytherins are
 Dark Wizards.
 There aren't all that many Dark Wizards, so not all Slytherins can be one.”
 Or as Father had said, while any Malfoy should certainly know much of the
 secret lore, the more… 
\emph on
costly
\emph default
 rituals were better left to useful fools like Amycus Carrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“So yeh're saying,” Hagrid said, “that most Dark Wizards are Slytherins…
 but…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“But most Slytherins are not Dark Wizards,” Draco said.
 He had a weary feeling they'd be at this a while, but like fighting a hydra,
 the important thing was to not give up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I never thought of it that way,” the huge man said, sounding awestruck.
 “But, well, if yeh're not all a house of snakes, then why -- 
\emph on
get behind that tree!

”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hagrid seized Draco and Tracey and hoisted them off the path behind a towering
 oak.
 He pulled out a bolt

 and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire.
 The three of them listened.
 Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak
 trailing along the ground.
 Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound
 faded away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I knew it,” Hagrid murmured.
 “There's summat in here that shouldn' be.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They went after where the rustling sound had come from, with Hagrid in the
 lead and Tracey and Draco both gripping their wands at the ready, but they
 found nothing, despite searching in a widening circle with their ears straining
 for the faintest sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked on through the dense, dark trees.
 Draco kept looking over his shoulder, a feeling nagging at him that they
 were being watched.
 They had just passed a bend in the path when Tracey yelled and pointed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the distance, a shower of red sparks lit the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted.
 “Stay where yeh are, I'll come back for yeh!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Draco could say a word, Hagrid spun and crashed away through the
 undergrowth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco and Tracey stood looking at each other, until they heard nothing but
 the rustling of leaves around them.
 Tracey looked scared, but trying to hide it.
 Draco was feeling more annoyed than anything else.

 Rubeus Hagrid, when he had formed his plans for tonight, had not spent
 even five seconds visualizing the consequences if something actually went
 wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Now what?” said Tracey, her voice a little high.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“We wait for Mr.
 Hagrid to come back.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minutes dragged by.
 Draco's ears seemed sharper than usual, picking up every sigh of the wind,
 every cracking twig.
 Tracey kept looking up at the moon, as though to reassure herself that
 it wasn't full yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm

 “I'm getting a little nervous, Mr.

\begin_layout Standard
Draco thought about it a bit.
 To be honest, there 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 something… well, it wasn't that he was a coward, or even that he was scared.
 But there had been a murder at Hogwarts and if he'd been watching himself
 in a play, having just been abandoned in the Forbidden Forest by a half-giant,
 he would currently feel like yelling at the boy on stage that he should…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Draco reached into his robes, and took out a mirror.
 Tapping the surface showed a man in red robes, who frowned almost immediately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Auror Captain Eneasz Brodski,” the man said clearly, causing Tracey to
 start with the loudness in the quiet forest.
 “What is it, Draco Malfoy?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Put me on ten-minute check-in,” Draco said.
 He'd decided not to complain directly about his detention.
 He did 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 want to look like a spoiled brat.
 “If I don't respond, come get me.
 I'm in the Forbidden Forest.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the mirror, the Auror's brows rose.
 “What are you doing in the Forbidden Forest, Mr.
 Malfoy?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Looking for the unicorn-eater with Mr.
 Hagrid,” Draco said, and tapped the mirror off, putting it back in his
 robes before the Auror could ask anything about detentions or say anything
 about serving it out without complaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's head turned toward him, though it was a little too dim to read
 her expression.
 “Um, thanks,” she whispered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The few leaves which had emerged on their branches rustled as another, colder
 breeze blew through the forest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's voice was a little louder when she spoke again.
 “You didn't have to

 but he was afraid she would consider that flirting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey's silhouetted head turned from him, looked away.
 Finally she said, in a smaller voice, “It's too soon, isn't it

A high scream echoed through the woods, a not-quite-human sound, the scream

Brambles whipped at Draco's eyes, he had to keep one hand in front of his

Another unicorn lay on the ground, surrounded by a slowly widening pool
 of silver blood, the edge of the blood creeping across the ground like
 spilled mercury.
 Her coat was purple, like the color of the night sky, her horn exactly
 the same twilight color as her skin, her visible flank marked by a pink
 star-blotch surrounded by white patches.
 The sight tore at Draco's heart, even more than the other unicorn because

The blurring, seething, unrecognizable darkness seemed to turn to regard
 them.
 A hiss came from it, like the hiss of the deadliest snake which ever had
 existed, something more dangerous by far than any Blue Krait.

Then it bent back over the wound in the unicorn, and continued to drink.

The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanica

Tracey was holding her wand now, saying things like “Prismatis” and “Stupefy”
 but nothing was happening.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the seething outline rose up, like a man rising to his feet only not
 so; and it seemed to scuttle forward, moving with a strange half-jump across
 the dying unicorn's legs, approaching the two of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tracey tugged at his sleeve and then turned to run, run from something that
 could hunt down unicorns.
 Before she could take three steps there came another terrible hiss, burning
 his ears, and Tracey fell to the ground and did not move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco knew that he was about to die.
 Even if the Auror checked his mirror this very instant, there was no way
 anyone could get here fast enough.
 There was no

The seething outline came closer, while Draco tried, in his last moments,
 to solve the riddle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then a blazing silver ball of light plunged out of the night sky and hung
 there, illuminating the forest as bright as daylight, and the seething
 outline leapt backwards, as though in horror of the light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four broomsticks plunged out of the sky, three Aurors with bright multicolored
 shields and Harry Potter holding his wand aloft, seated behind Professor
 McGonagall within a larger shield.

 The three Aurors and Professor McGonagall fell off their broomsticks and
 dropped heavily to the forest floor, lying motionless.

 The silver moonlight gleamed on his face.
 “Run, Draco! I'll hold it off!”

“You can't fight that thing alone!” Draco cried aloud.
 A nausea was in his stomach, a churning sensation that, looking back in
 memory, seemed both like and unlike a sense of guilt, as though it had
 the sensations but not quite all of the emotion.

Harry held a tight grip on his wand, a Prismatic Sphere glowing around him.
 He stared levelly at the seething, blurring form in front of him, and said,
 “What on Earth are you doing?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The seething blurs resolved, reformed, relaxed back into a hooded form.
 Whatever concealment had been at work -- a device rather than a Charm,
 Harry guessed, since the magic had been able to affect him -- had prevented
 his mind from recognizing the shape or even that the shape was human.
 But it hadn't prevented Harry from recognizing the sharp sense of doom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell stood straight with silver blood all down the front of
 his enshrouding black cloak, and gave a sigh, looking at the fallen forms
 of three Aurors, Tracey Davis, Draco Malfoy, and Professor McGonagall.
 “I had honestly thought,” Professor Quirrell murmured, “that I jammed that
 mirror without alarm.
 What were two first-year Slytherins doing alone in the Forbidden Forest?
 Mr.
 Malfoy has more sense than this… What a fiasco.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry didn't answer.
 The sense of doom was as strong as Harry could ever remember feeling it,
 a feeling of power in the air so great that it was almost tangible.
 Some part of him was still viscerally shocked at how fast the shields surroundi
ng the Aurors had been torn apart.
 He almost hadn't been able to

 the successive lashes of color which had torn away the shields like tissue
 paper.
 It made the duel Professor Quirrell had fought against the Auror in Azkaban
 look like a mockery, a child's game -- though Professor Quirrell had claimed,
 then, that if he'd fought for real the Auror would have been dead in seconds;
 and Harry knew now that this was also true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just how high did the power ladder go?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I take it,” Harry said, managing to keep his voice steady, “that your eating
 unicorns has something to do with why you'll get fired from the Defense
 Professor position.
 I don't suppose you'd care to explain in considerable detail?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell looked at him.
 The almost tangible sense of power in the air seemed to diminish, drawing
 back into the Defense Professor.
 “I shall indeed explain myself,” the Defense Professor said.
 “I need to cast a few Memory Charms first, and then we may go off and discuss
 it, for it would not be wise for me to stay.
 You will return to this time later, as I know.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry willed himself to be able to see through the Cloak he had mastered;
 and knew that another Harry stood beside him, hidden by his own Deathly
 Hallow.
 Harry then told his Cloak to hide himself from himself once more, and it
 did; being able to perceive your future self meant having to match the
 memory later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's own voice said, then, sounding strange in present-Harry's ears,
 “He has a surprisingly good explanation.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Present-Harry remembered the words as best he could.
 Nothing more was said between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell walked to Draco's form, and chanted the spell of the
 False Memory Charm.
 The Defense Professor stood there for perhaps a minute, seemingly lost
 to the world.

, these last couple of weeks -- though he couldn't have helped cast the
 spells, unless he was willing to exhaust himself almost completely, and
 for some reason they wanted an Auror to lose every single life memory involving
 the color blue.
 But Harry had some idea, now, of the concentration which the far more difficult
 False Memory Charm entailed.
 You had to try to live the other person's entire life inside your own head,
 at least if you wanted to create the False Memories with less than a sixteen-to
-one slowdown as you separately crafted sixteen major tracks of memory.
 It might have been quiet, there might have been no outward sign; but Harry
 knew something of the difficulties now, and he knew to be impressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell finished, and moved on to Tracey Davis, then the three
 Aurors, and finally Professor McGonagall.
 Harry waited, but future-Harry made no protest.
 It was possible that even Professor McGonagall, if she'd been awake, wouldn't
 have protested.
 It was not yet the Ides of May, and apparently there would be a surprisingly
 good explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a gesture, Draco's stunned body was lifted, and sent a short distance
 into the woods, before being carefully deposited on the ground.
 Then a final gesture from Professor Quirrell ripped a huge chunk out of
 the unicorn's side, leaving behind ragged edges; the raw meat hovered in
 the air, then wavered in Vanishment and was gone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Done,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “I must depart this place now, Mr.
 Potter.
 Come with me, and remain here.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell strode away, and Harry followed and remained behind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They walked through the woods in silence for a time, before Harry heard
 faint voices in the distance.
 The next set of Aurors, presumably, after the first set had fallen out
 of contact.
 What his future self was saying, Harry didn't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“They won't detect us, nor hear our speech,” said Professor Quirrell.
 The sense of power and doom around the Defense Professor was still strong.
 The man seated himself on a tree stump, one where the light of the almost-full
 moon fell full on him.
 “I should first say that when you speak to the Aurors, in the future, you
 should tell them that you frightened away the seething dark, the same as
 you did that Dementor.
 It is what Mr.
 Malfoy will remember seeing.” Professor Quirrell gave a small sigh.
 “It may cause some alarm, if they conclude that some horror kin to Dementors,
 and strong enough to break the Aurors' shields, is loose in the Forbidden
 Forest.
 But I could not think of what else to do.
 If the forest is better-guarded after this -- but with any luck I have
 already consumed what I need.
 Would you mind telling me how you arrived so quickly? How did you know
 Mr.
 Malfoy was in trouble?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the Forbidden
 Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid, Brodski had begun inquiring
 to find out who had authorized this, and had still been unable to find
 out when Draco Malfoy had missed check-in.
 Despite Harry's protests, the Auror Captain, who was authorized to know
 about Time-Turners, had refused to allow deployment to before the time
 of the missed check-in; there were standard procedures involving Time.
 But Brodski had given Harry written orders allowing him to go back and
 deploy an Auror trio to arrive one second after the missed check-in time.
 There had been a Patronus Charm to locate Draco, which Harry had successfully
 willed to take the form of a ball of pure silver light, and the flight
 of Aurors had arrived on time to the second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I'm afraid I couldn't say,” Harry replied evenly.
 Professor Quirrell was still a major suspect, and it was good for him not
 to know the details.
 “Now why are you eating unicorns?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Ah,” Professor Quirrell said.
 “As to that…” The man hesitated.
 “I was drinking the blood of unicorns, not eating them.
 The missing flesh, the ragged marks upon the body -- those were to obscure
 the case, to make it seem like some other predator.
 The use of unicorn's blood is too well-known.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I don't know it,” Harry said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I know you do not,” the Defense Professor said sharply.
 “Or you would not be pestering me about it.
 The power of unicorn's blood is to preserve your life for a time, even
 if you are on the very verge of death.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a stretch of time when Harry's brain claimed to be refusing to
 process the words, which was of course a lie, because you couldn't know
 the meaning you weren't allowed to process, without having already processed
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A strange sense of blankness overtook Harry, an absence of reaction, maybe
 this was what other people felt like when someone went off-script, and
 they couldn't say or think of anything to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course Professor Quirrell was dying, not just occasionally ill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Professor Quirrell had known he was dying.
 He'd volunteered to take the Defense Professor position at Hogwarts, after
 all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course he'd been getting worse the whole school year.
 Of course illnesses which kept getting worse had a predictable destination
 at their end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry's brain had surely known already, somewhere in the safe back of his
 mind where he could refuse to process things he'd already processed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course that was why Professor Quirrell wouldn't be able to teach Battle
 Magic next year.
 Professor McGonagall wouldn't even have to fire him.
 He would just be --

Harry's breath hitched.
 Too many emotions were bubbling up in him at once.
 After denial came anger, according to a ritual someone had just made up.
 And yet it seemed surprisingly appropriate.

“And why --” Harry's breath hitched again.
 “Why isn't unicorn's blood standard in healer's kits, then? To keep someone

 Harry had learned the Charm only ten days previously, after he'd started
