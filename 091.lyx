 after, there was another knock upon the storeroom door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“If you actually care about my mental health,” the boy said without looking
 up, “you will go away, leave me alone, and wait for me to come down to
 dinner.
 This isn't helping.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door opened, and the one who had waited outside stepped in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Seriously?” the boy said flatly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door closed and clicked behind Severus Snape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Potions Master of Hogwarts wore none of his customary arrogance, or
 even the dispassionate guise that he ordinarily took in the Headmaster's
 office; his gaze was strange, as he looked down upon the boy guarding that
 door; his thoughts unfathomable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I also cannot imagine what the Deputy Headmistress is thinking,” said the
 Potions Master of Hogwarts.
 “Unless I am meant to serve as a warning of where it will lead you, if
 you decide to take the blame for her death upon yourself.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy's lips pressed together.
 “Fine.
 Let's just skip ahead to the end of this conversation.
 You win, Professor Snape.
 I concede that you were more responsible for Lily Potter's death than I
 was responsible for Hermione Granger's death, and that my guilt can't stack
 up to your guilt.
 And then I ask you to go, and you tell them that it would probably be best
 to let me alone for a while.
 Are we done?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Almost,” the Potions Master said.
 “I am the one who put the notes under Miss Granger's pillow, telling her
 where to find the fights in which she intervened.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy did not react to this at all.
 Finally he spoke.
 “Because you dislike bullying.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Not that alone.” There was a note of pain in the Potions Master's voice
 that sounded alien to it; it was hard to imagine it being the same acid
 voice that instructed children not to stir one more time or they'd blow
 off their wrists.
 “I should have realized it… very much earlier, I suppose, and yet I did
 not see it at all, being entirely absorbed in myself.
 For me to be placed as Head of Slytherin… it means that Albus Dumbledore
 has entirely lost hope that Slytherin House can be helped.
 I am certain that Dumbledore must have tried, I cannot imagine that he
 did not try, when he first took trust of Hogwarts.
 It must have been a severe blow to him, when after that so much of Slytherin
 answered to the Dark Lord's call… he would not have placed me in authority
 over that House, acting as I did, unless he had lost all hope.” The Potions
 Master's shoulders fell, beneath his spotted and stained cloak.
 “But you and Miss Granger were trying to do something, and the two of you
 had even managed to bring over Mr.
 Malfoy and Miss Greengrass, and perhaps those two could have set a different
 example… I suppose it was foolish for me to believe.
 The Headmaster does not know of what I have done, and I ask you not to
 tell him.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Why are you telling me this?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Matters have become far too serious not to tell someone.” Severus Snape's
 lips twisted.
 “I have seen enough disastrous plotting, in my tenure as Head of Slytherin,
 to know how that sometimes goes.
 If, in the future, all should come to light -- then at least I have told
 you, and you may say as much.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Lovely,” the boy said.
 “Thank you for clearing that up.
 Is that all?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Do you intend to declare that your life is now a ruin and that there is
 nothing left for you but vengeance?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Then there is very little advice that I can give you,” said Severus Snape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy nodded distantly.
 “On Hermione's behalf, thank you for helping her with the bullies.
 She would tell you that it was the right thing to do.
 And now I would be much obliged if you could tell them to 
\emph on
leave me alone
\emph default
.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Potions Master turned to the door, and when his face was unseen, his
 voice came in a whisper.
 “I truly am sorry for your loss.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Severus Snape departed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy stared after him, trying to remember, as best as he could at this
 distance, words which had been spoken some time earlier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Your books betrayed you, Potter.
 They did not tell you the one thing you needed to know.
 You cannot learn from books what it is like to lose the one you love.
 That is something you could never know without experiencing it for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had gone something like that, the boy thought, if he was remembering
 correctly.

\begin_layout Standard
Hours had passed now, in the infirmary section with its closed door and
 a body lying in state behind it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Harry went on staring at his wand, as it lay in his lap.
 At the tiny scratches and smudges on the eleven inches of holly, flaws
 he'd never looked closely enough to notice before.
 A quick mental calculation said there was no reason to worry since if this
 was six or seven months' accumulation of damage, then a standard lifetime
 wouldn't wear away the wand entirely.
 At the time, he probably would've worried about his own Time-Turner being
 taken away if he'd just openly yelled out `Does anyone have a Time-Turner?'
 into the Great Hall, but it would have been easy enough to precommit to,
 after lunch, finding someone to send Professor Flitwick a message two hours
 earlier and then Professor Flitwick could've just gone straight to Hermione,
 or sent her his raven Patronus, long before the troll was anywhere near
 her.
 Or might that alternate Harry have already learned it was too late -- heard
 about Hermione's death after lunch and before he could buy any messages
 sent backwards in time? Maybe a basic guideline of working with time-travel
 was to make sure you never risked learning you were too late, if you hadn't
 yet gone backwards.
 There was a tiny chemical burn now on the end of his wand, presumably from
 contacting the acid he'd partially Transfigured the troll's brain into,
 but the wand seemed robust against losses of small amounts of wood.
 Really the concept of a `magic wand' being required just got stranger the
 more you thought about it.
 Though if spells were always being invented in some mysterious way, new
 rituals being carved as new levers upon the unknown machine, it might just
 be that people just kept inventing rituals that involved wands, just like
 they invented phrases like `Wingardium Leviosa'.
 It really seemed like magic ought to be, in some sense, almost arbitrarily
 powerful, and it certainly would be convenient if Harry could just bypass
 whatever conceptual limitation prevented people from inventing spells like
 `Just Fix Everything Forever', but somehow nothing was ever that easy where
 magic was concerned.
 Harry looked at his mechanical watch again, but it still wasn't time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He'd attempted to cast the Patronus Charm, meaning to tell his Patronus
 to go to Hermione Granger.
 Just in case it was all a lie, a False Memory Charm or one of the who-knew-how-
many-ways that wizards could be made to close their eyes and dream.
 Just in case the real Hermione was alive and being held somewhere, despite
 his feeling her life as it left her.
 Just in case there was an afterlife and the True Patronus could reach it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spell hadn't worked though, so that particular test had failed to provide
 any evidence, leaving him with the previous, unfavorable prior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time passed, and yet more time.
 From the outside you would've just seen a boy, sitting, staring at his
 wand with an abstracted gaze, looking at his watch every two minutes or
 so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door to the infirmary section opened once

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy sitting there looked up with a deadly, chilling glare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the boy's face cracked in dismay, and he scrambled to his feet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry,” said the man in the button-down formal shirt and a black vest thrown
 over it.
 His voice was hoarse.
 “Harry, what's happening? The Headmaster of your school -- he showed up
 in those ridiculous robes at my office and told me that Hermione Granger
 was dead!”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moment later a woman followed the man into the room; she seemed less confused
 than the man, less bewildered and more frightened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Dad,” the boy said thinly.
 “Mum.
 Yes, she's dead.
 They didn't tell you anything else?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“No! Harry, what's happening?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a pause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy slumped back against the wall.
 “I c-can't, I can't, I can't do this.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“What?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I can't pretend to be a little boy, I j-just don't have the energy right
 now.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry,” the woman said falteringly.
 “Harry

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Dad, you know those fantasy books where the hero has to hide everything
 from his parents because they, they wouldn't understand, they'd react stupidly
 and get in the hero's way? It's a plot device, right, so that the hero
 has to solve everything himself instead of telling his parents.
 P-please don't be that plot device, Dad, or you either, Mum.
 Just… just don't play that role.
 Don't be the parents who won't understand.
 D-don't yell at me and give me parental demands I can't follow.
 Because I've wandered into a bloody stupid fantasy novel and now Hermione's
 -- I j-just don't have the energy to deal with it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly, as though his limbs were only half-animated, the man in the black
 vest kneeled down to where Harry was standing, so that his eyes were level
 with his son's.
 “Harry,” the man said.
 “I need you to tell me everything that has happened, right now.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy took a deep breath, swallowed.
 “They t-tell me the Dark Lord I defeated may still be alive.
 Like that's not the p-plot of a hundred sodding books, right? So, it could
 also be that the Headmaster of my school, who's the most powerful wizard
 in the world, has gone insane.
 And, and Hermione was framed for an attempted murder just before this,
 not that anyone would've told her parents about it or anything.
 The student she was framed for attempted-murdering was the son of Lucius
 Malfoy, who's the most powerful politician in magical Britain, and used
 to be the Dark Lord's number two.
 The Defense Professor position at this school has a curse on it, nobody
 ever lasts more than a year, they have a saying that the Defense Professor
 is always a suspect.
 This year the Defense Professor is secretly a mysterious wizard who opposed
 the Dark Lord during the last war and may or may not be evil himself.
 Also the Potions Master has been pining after Lily Potter for years and
 might be behind this whole thing for some twisted psychological reason.”
 The boy's lips pressed together bitterly.
 “I think that's most of the bloody stupid plot.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man, who had listened to all this quietly, stood up.
 He put a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder.
 “That's enough, Harry,” he said.
 “I've heard enough.
 We're leaving this school right now and taking you with us.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woman was looking at the boy, her face asking a question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy gazed back at her and nodded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The woman's voice was thin when she spoke.
 “

“They'll say, you're crazy, have a nice stay in this asylum.
 That's assuming the Ministry Obliviators don't get to you first and erase
 your memories.
 They do that to Muggles a lot, I hear.
 I figure the real higher-ups in our government have formed some cozy accommodat
ions of their own.
 Maybe they get a few healing Charms now and then, if someone important
 manages to get cancer.” The boy gave that twisted smile again.
 “And that's the situation, Dad, as Mum already knows.
 They'd never have brought you here or told you anything, if there was a
 single thing you could do about it.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The man's mouth opened but no words came out, as though he had been reading
 from a script which described what a concerned parent ought to do in this
 sort of situation, and this script had suddenly arrived at a blank spot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry,” the woman said falteringly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy looked at her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry, did something happen to you? You seem… different…”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Petunia!” the man said, his tongue apparently working once more.
 “Don't say such things! He's under stress, that's all.”

“I've got… you know how that school psychiatrist thought I had anger management

 “I don't know how to explain this to you, Mum.
 It's something magical instead.
 Probably something to do with whatever happened on the night my parents
 died.

 there's something inside me, it gave me willpower when things were bad,
 I could face down anything so long as I was angry, Snape, Dumbledore, the
 entire Wizengamot, my dark side wasn't afraid of anything but Dementors.
 And I wasn't stupid, I knew that there might be a price for using my dark
 side and I kept on looking to see what the price might be.
 It didn't change my magic, it didn't seem to cause permanent alignment
 shift, it didn't try to take me away from my friends or anything like that,
 so I kept on using it whenever I had to and I only figured out too late
 what the price really was

 “I only figured out today… every time I call on it… it uses up my childhood.
 I killed the thing that got Hermione.
 And it wasn't my dark side that did it, it was me.
 Oh, Mum, Dad, I'm sorry.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was a long silence filled with the sound of broken masks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry,” the man said, kneeling down again, “I need you to start over from
 the beginning and explain that much more slowly.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy spoke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parents listened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some time later, the father stood up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy looked up at him, grimacing in bitter anticipation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Harry,” the man said, “Petunia and I are going to get you out of here as
 quickly as possible

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Don't,” the boy said warningly.
 “I mean it, Dad.
 The Ministry of Magic isn't something you can stand up to.
 Pretend they're the tax office or the dean or something else that won't
 brook any challenge to their dominance.
 In magical Britain you're only allowed to remember what the government
 thinks you should remember, and remembering the existence of magic or that
 you have a son named Harry is a privilege, not a right.
 And if they did that I'd crack and turn the Ministry into a giant flaming
 crater.
 Mum, you know the score, you absolutely have to stop Dad from trying anything
 stupid.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“And son

 “Maybe I shouldn't say this now… but are you sure that what you're talking
 about is really a magical dark side, and not something normal for a boy
 your age?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Normal,” the boy said with elaborate patience.
 “Normal how, exactly? I could check again, but I'm reasonably sure there

 “Why does everyone keep thinking it has to be about that? It's disrespectful

 “Anyway, son, you keep yourself safe while we work on getting you out of

 room, glaring directly at her.

She did not reply that she had been thinking about Harry sitting in front
 of the door to the storeroom containing Hermione's body, refusing to move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Who else knows about this?” Harry Potter demanded.
 “Did anyone see them with you?”
\end_layout

“The Headmaster brought them here

“I want them out of here

 before anyone else notices, especially You-Know-Who, but also including
 Professor Quirrell or Professor Snape.
 Please send your Patronus to the Headmaster and tell him that he needs
 to bring it back at once.
 Do not mention my parents by name, or as people, in case somebody else
 is listening.”

“Indeed,” said Professor Verres-Evans, nodding sternly along with this from
 where he stood directly behind the boy, Petunia a step behind him.
 His hand rested firmly on Harry's shoulder.
 “We'll finish talking to our son at home.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“A moment, please,” Minerva said in reflexive politeness.
 Her first try at casting the Patronus failed, a disadvantage of that Charm
 under certain circumstances.
 It wasn't the first time she'd done it so, but she seemed to have lost
 some of the knack

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva shut the thought down and concentrated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the message was sent, she turned back to Professor Verres-Evans.
 “Sir,” she said, “I'm afraid that Mr.
 Potter must not leave the Hogwarts School

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time Albus finally arrived, there was shouting, the Muggle man having
 given up on dignity.
 At least there was shouting on one side of the argument.
 Minerva's heart wasn't in it.
 The truth was that she couldn't believe the words coming out of her mouth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the Professor turned to argue with the Headmaster, Harry Potter, who
 had remained silent through this, spoke up.
 “Not here,” said Harry.
 “You can argue with him anywhere but Hogwarts, Dad.
 Mum, please, please make sure that Dad doesn't try anything that will get
 him in trouble with the Ministry.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michael Verres-Evans's face screwed up.
 He turned, looked at Harry Potter.
 When his voice came out it was hoarse, accompanied by water in his eyes.
 “Son -- what are you doing?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“You know perfectly well what I'm doing,” Harry Potter said.
 “You read those comic books long before you gave them to me.
 I've been through a bunch of crap, matured a bit, and now I'm protecting
 my relatives.
 Actually, it's simpler than that, you know what I'm doing because you tried
 to do the same thing.
 I'm having my loved ones taken out of Hogwarts immediately, that's what
 I'm doing.
 Headmaster, please get them out of here before You-Know-Who discovers their
 presence and marks them for death.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Michael Verres-Evans began a frantic dash toward Harry, and then all motion
 stopped with the Muggle man leaning forward in his flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I am sorry,” the Headmaster said quietly.
 “We shall speak more soon.
 Minerva, I was with the others when you called, they are waiting in your
 office.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Headmaster passed forwards like he was gliding, until he stood in the
 midst of where the man and woman stood frozen; and there was another flash
 of flame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motion resumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minerva looked at Harry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Words did not come to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Clever move, bringing them here,” Harry Potter said.
 “Probably damaged our relationship permanently.
 All I wanted was to be bloody left alone until bloody dinnertime.
 Which,” the boy looked at his wristwatch, “it now is 
\emph on
anyway
\emph default
.
 I'm going to go say goodbye to Hermione by myself, which I promise will
 take less than two minutes, and then after that I'll come out and go eat
 something like I would have done regardless.
 Do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 disturb me for those two bloody minutes or I will snap and try to kill
 someone, I mean it, Professor.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy turned and strode into the small room, opened the rear door to where
 Hermione Granger's body was being kept, and strode inside before she could
 think to speak.
 Through the doorway she saw a flash of a sight she knew no child ought
 to see --
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The door slammed shut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She started forwards, unthinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Halfway to the door, she stopped herself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her mind was still slow, and hurting, and the part of her that Harry Potter
 would have called 
\emph on
the picture of a stern disciplinarian
\emph default
 was lifelessly mouthing words about inappropriate behavior from children.
 The rest of her didn't think it was a good idea to leave any child, even
 Harry Potter, alone in a room with the bloody corpse of his best friend.
 But the act of opening the door, or asserting any sort of authority, did
 not seem to her wise.
 There was no right thing to do, and no right thing to say; or if there
 was any right path, she did not know it.

\begin_layout Standard
Very slowly, a minute and a half passed.

When the door opened again, Harry seemed to have changed, as though that
 minute and a half had passed over the course of lifetimes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Seal up the room,” Harry said quietly, “and let's go, Professor McGonagall.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She walked over to the storeroom door.
 She wasn't quite able to stop herself from looking in, and saw the dried
 blood, the sheet covering the lower half, the upper body waxy and doll-like,
 and a glimpse of Hermione Granger's closed eyes.
 Something inside her began its weeping all over again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She closed the door.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her fingers moved upon her wand, her mouth spoke words without thought,
 Charms and wards to seal the room against entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Professor McGonagall,” Harry said in a strange voice, as if by rote, “do
 you have the rock? The rock that the Headmaster gave me? I should Transfigure
 it into a jewel again, since it did prove useful.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automatically her eyes went to the ring on Harry's left pinky finger, noting
 the emptiness of the setting where the jewel should have been.
 “I shall mention it to the Headmaster,” her tongue replied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Is that a usual tactic, by the way?” Harry said, voice still odd.
 “Carrying something large Transfigured into something small to use as a
 weapon? Or is that a usual exercise for Transfiguration practice?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distantly, she shook her head.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Well, let's go, then.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“I have

 “I'm afraid I have something else which I must do, now.
 Will you be all right on your own, and will you promise to go to the Great
 Hall directly and eat something, Mr.
 Potter?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boy promised (barring exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, a clause
 with which she did not argue) and then walked out of the room.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What lay ahead of her… would be no easier, certainly, and might well be
 harder.
